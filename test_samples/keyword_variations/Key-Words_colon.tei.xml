				<p>Electricity is the common problem in many countries and to fulfil the requirements of people in these countries a system is designed which use sun light to generate electricity. This system requires solar panel to convert sun light into dc voltage and then start working and charge the dc bank and then electricity is generated by inverters. By using this system we are having full control on grid supply. If according to the requirement of user power from solar panels is available then solar management and interface unit cut the mains from the inverter and load runs through the power generate by solar charge controller from solar panels. And system check time to time for the power required by user and generated from solar management and interface unit using solar panels. If there is a difference in available power and required power then microcontroller switch the system to mains mode. And also check again and again if at any time power from solar is equal to the requirement then again mains cut and system starts its working and also charge the batteries used by the system. And if current is available from solar panels but less than the requirement in such a case the available power from solar side is utilize to charge the batteries only. In the present world there is a lot of increase in energy demand. It is time for us to come up with innovative solutions as we are going short of our available resources. Though the utilization of solar energy is very less compared to other available resources at present, it is going to double in future.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>This project aims at developing a highly cost-effective natural solar charge controller and management unit which would complete the needs of people in rural and urban areas both. The system uses non-polluting natural resources to produce electricity and so is eco friendly. It can easily be customized as per requirements and available resources to suit the needs of different households and industries. This idea has been successfully tested and a working prototype has been developed. Power plants in many countries are mostly dependent on gas &amp; fuel which is not renewable. The reserve of the gas or bio- fuel is very much limited and may be consumed in the future, so it is not a sustainable power generation source. Sustainable sources like solar photovoltaic are becoming efficient as well as environmentally friendly relative to fossil fuels. PV arrays produce power when it is illuminated; PV systems often use battery to capture the electrical energy which can be used at later time. In addition, storage batteries can also provide transient suppression and voltage regulation. The providers of solar panel are trying to reduce the price of batteries and the associated accessories. Sustainable sources are favourable for the environment, but they aren't easy to apply. Application of sustainable energy sources can be successful if power conversion and energy storage are made efficient. Charge controller is an important part of all power systems that charge the batteries, whether the source is photovoltaic, wind, hydro or utility grid. Its sole purpose is to keep the batteries safe for the long term. In other terms, it is a regulator that goes between the solar panels and the batteries. They are used to keep the batteries charged at peak without overcharging the batteries.</p><p>Being a developing country with a huge burden of fuel import, the need of solar energy research and Development in India cannot be over-emphasized. The geographical location of India is also quite favourable for solar energy implementation. However, a densely-populated country like India, with a fragmented electricity market, poses endless challenges to the scientists and entrepreneurs. The nature of Indian electricity market is quite unique, and cannot be compared directly with other countries. Unlike USA or Japan, India has numerous villages and islands unconnected from the main grid, spatial and seasonal variation in agricultural demand, and cottage-to large-scale industrial sectors. Our objective is to design such a system which really helps people in such areas where electricity department doesn't fulfil the requirement and sun light available easily. The design is prepared after studying many parameters like -cost effective, efficient, easy to install, and most important thing easy to use. Day by day it is increasing the energy demand in the world, but resource is very limited. Everyone try to develop some things to use limited resource which are available in the world. Energy crisis, these problems are not new problem for us, every nation, and every country is trying to solve the problems in the various ways such as solar energy, oil, electricity, gas etc. Maximum peoples are tried to solve these problems to use conventional energy, but some peoples are tried to solve these problem to focus the alternative ways; they main concern to save the environment to meet our energy demand; they are mainly focus on the renewable energy. The underlying principle is the phenomenon of natural process that takes place due to energy conversion. The sun light falls on the solar panel which is made by using photovoltaic cells which converts the sunlight in the form of current and voltage. And we use the sun light for charge dc bank by using which we further generate electricity. And this kind of projects also appreciated by government.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ijre.org</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Batteries:</head><p>The batteries used in photovoltaic charge controller served as a way to store energy so that devices can be powered in the event that the sun is not shining and when more power is needed than can be provided by the solar arrays at a given time. The battery bank should provide a large energy capacity, run at 12V, and provide a large output current to handle high power loads. The system (SIM) uses batteries of both kind like tubular, C10, C20, Lead acid, Gel, SMF etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inverter:</head><p>The inverter is the final stage of the system. It is through the inverter that the user has the opportunity to access the power stored in the batteries that was originally generated in the solar panel. The main functionality of the inverter is to take the DC voltage stored in the batteries and transform it into AC voltage that can be used by small household appliances or sent to grid for commercial purpose. Functional Block Diagram: A basic system contains inverter, solar charge controller and battery module. And after installing each circuit together we check the working of the system. Working of project is easily understood by the block diagram and brief overview of the project is:</p><p>First of all we connect the inverter and the battery and then connect the solar charge controller to the battery and mains provides to the inverter is first going to the solar energy conversion and energy saver module and then to the inverter and solar panels are connected to the solar charge controller. The phenomenon of mains connected first to solar energy converter is that it checks first the solar power availability and if it is enough to charge the batteries or run the load then it does not connect mains to the inverter and if in a case solar current is not fulfil the requirement then it connects the mains to the inverter. The benefits of using a inverter in this combination is that we save the mains power on a hand and also save the life of batteries and the most important thing is we utilize the solar power.</p><p>As we know that we get the solar power from the sun and this is not a continuous source. Maximum 8 or 9 hours in a day we get the solar power from the sun.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig: Block diagram of solar energy conversion and energy saver module</head><p>Switching Section: Switching section is the most important part of the project. Output of solar panels is controlled by this section. In this system Positive end of the battery is connected with the positive ends of the Panel. Switching is conduct at negative end by using of power MOSFET (IRF640).The combination of microcontroller and mosfet is used to control the load operation of the charge controller. Solar panel voltage is checked by the microcontroller. Microcontroller then verifies it with the condition written on it. If all the requirements are fulfilled then a pwm signal is sent to the MOSFET for its operation. Now switching is established by the controller and charging of batteries is start. In this way transistor and relay are used to control the charging process. Microcontroller takes the decision for all controls and protections by the help of the logics written on it. If everything is okay then a pwm signal is generated by the microcontroller to establish the connection between the battery and the panel.</p><p>And battery is charged to its full state. If the condition is not fulfilled or solar current is not available then a signal from the ijre.org microcontroller is generate for relay operation and relay is connected to normally open point. Because one terminal of Relay must be higher potential and other should be lower potential so that the Relay can be energized. So the circuit is now completed and there is charge flow to the battery from mains side. As shown in the figure the feedback is taken for output control. The feedback is monitoring both the output voltage and output current if anyone from both is disturbed from their respective position then microcontroller shut off the mosfet with such logic that output voltage and current both are controlled. In this technique the circuit working for checking the voltage level of the batteries and their charging current requirement and then power generated by the module to charge the batteries and for the load. The circuit used for this operation is very simple and low in cost. <ref type="bibr">Many</ref>  3-step charging to provide quick and safe charging for battery</p><p>Energy Saver: System is energy saver because it use natural source to charge battery and to drive load and also save energy because it control the uses of grid supply as per the availability of power from sun. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS:</head><p>The test was conducted at the PV demonstration room on September 7, 2015 from exactly 7:00AM to 13:30PM. In conducting the charging test, 300W solar module was used to provide charging voltage. A digital multimeter was used to measure the initial voltage of the battery as well as solar panel voltage. Another digital meter was connected across the solar module to measure the solar panel current. With the connection completed, the charge controller was switched on. A message reading "charging" as well as the battery voltage displayed on the LCD. The solar panel voltage charging voltage also noted and recorded at the beginning of the charging experiment. Subsequently, the values were recorded after every 30 minutes interval. All the values obtained and tabulated. The experiment continued until the battery became fully charged. At this point the LCD displayed "Battery full". System is tested as per the requirements and result was recorded and shown in the table below: System average efficiency is greater then and equal to 80%. And peak efficiency is 87%. <ref type="table">Table:</ref> System Efficiency Goals of Research: Solar interface and management unit is a hybrid system which having solar panels at input and battery and load at output side and mains supply from grid also route to electric appliance through it. Main reason of route grid supply through solar interface and management unit is this it is working in energy saver mode also means if power available from solar panels capable to drive the load then it cuts the grid supply from the load and drive the load by solar power only. Main reason of designing such kind of system is to use natural resources and save energy. The main concern during the design is to control the cost of system so that everybody who uses inverters at their home or office easily purchases this system and save electricity. Because solar interface and management system uses solar panels at input side to generate output and charge batteries or drive the load. If a series string of storage batteries are connected, system is charged all the batteries and current is divided equally to all the batteries. May be there are slight mismatches in characteristics, aging effects, and temperature differences cause charge imbalance in the form of unequal voltages along the string. Once the imbalance occurs, it tends to grow with time, i.e. some batteries charge/discharge less effectively and some batteries charge/discharge relatively quickly. So precautions are taken during installation because system is designed to ijre.org Improves battery life, Delivers energy for a longer time, Prevents increased battery damaged rates, Maximize the capacity, efficiency and reliability when operating the stack. The goal of this research is to develop a system which can achieve the following objective:</p><p> Energy Saver  Use Natural Resources  Battery Life Improvement  Good Efficiency  Low Cost  Easy Installation Scope of Work - As we know that electricity is a basic problem in many cities of India and also some other countries. So everyone needs such systems which fulfil their requirement of electricity and system is cost effective and best in service. With this phenomenon we are come to this point and finalize this project which meets the requirement with additional feature. The feature is in the areas where electricity is available by using this system user can save electricity and use sun power to generate electricity for their appliances.</p><p>Conclusion - PV system is required for our country. As we are not economically solvent the price of the accessories of solar system are too much high. For this purpose we did our work and research on solar charge controller. The cost is so much low as it is less than others and would be small in size. Cost is so much lower than other charge controller which is found in market. The algorithm used here is efficient for the charge controller operation. The charge controller also has hysteresis control and battery voltage indicator by both LCD display and LED. So it is useful for commercial purpose. And Grid supply also route through this system for save more energy.</p><p>Future Work: As present system is a pwm based charger in future we change the topology and prepare MPPT charge with MPPT algorithm for better efficiency. And grid feed inverter based on MPPT topology is also a great idea for the future work. But there is a need that feeding is start only when grid supply is available otherwise power generated by panels is wasted.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig: Solar Energy Conversion Unit With Energy Saver Solar Panels:</head><label></label><figDesc>Fig: Solar Energy Conversion Unit With Energy Saver Solar Panels: A photovoltaic array consists of several photovoltaic cells connected in series and parallel. Series connections are responsible for increasing the voltage of the module whereas parallel connections are responsible for increasing the current in the array. Typically a solar cell can be modelled by a current source and an inverted diode connected in parallel to it.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Features of the proposed scheme: 1 . Energy Saver; as uses solar panels to generate power and save electricity. 2 . Charging batteries with proper charging cycle. 3 . Improvement over switched-capacitor schemes because charge transfer takes place between the higher SOC to the lower SOC battery. 4 . Eliminates the complexity of multiple bi-directional DC/DC converters. 5 . Increases reliability due to the avoidance of failure conditions in one or more batteries in a stack, by using an under-voltage and over-voltage protection circuit. Charge Equalization: A charging cycle is designed to charge the battery and control method is proposed to proper charge the batteries with gravity improvement. A set of MOSFET switches controlled by a microcontroller ensures that batteries are charged to a proper voltage level with proper charging current. The microcontroller monitors the voltage across each battery and makes decisions to generate switching signals to the MOSFET's, ensuring charge transfer in a stack.</head><label>12345</label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
