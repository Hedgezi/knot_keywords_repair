This research conduct at MTs Persatuan Amal Bakti (PAB) 1 Helvetia academic year 2017-2018 as the subject of researcher. The subject of this research were consisted of 48 students of the first grade in class VII-C. The research conduct with Classroom Action Research. In conducting this classroom action research, the researcher divided the action into two cycles. The instrument of collecting data are qualitative data from observation, interview, diary notes, and documentation. Quantitative data are take from tests, which was carried out in the end of every cycle. Based on the result of this research show that the students&apos; score increase from the first meeting namely cycle I until the last meeting namely cycle II. From the counting, the researcher find the mean of pre-test is 46.04, there is 8.33% (4 students) who get points up 75. In the post test cycle I, the mean is 68.54, it is higher than pre-test. There is 45.83% (22 students) who get points up 75 in post test I of cycle I. In the post test cycle II, the mean was 78.12, it was higher than post test I. There is 77.08% (37 students) who get points up 75 in post test I of cycle I. In the other words, the students&apos; vocabulary mastery is increased. Based on the observation, it show that the enthusiasm and excitementof the students are also improved. 52 CHAPTER V CONCLUSION SUGGESTION 5.1. Conclusion After carrying out the research and analyzing the data, the writer found that the students&apos; vocabulary achievement had been improved by applying anagram plus flashcards. It is shown from the mean of students&apos; score in pre-test was 46.04, the mean of students&apos; in post-test I was 68.54, and the mean of students&apos; score in post=test II was 78.12. The score&apos;s improvement from pre-test to post test I was increased 22.5 point and from post-test I to post-test II was increased 10.18 point. Based on diary note, observation sheet, and interview, the researcher found that teaching and learning process run well. Students were active, cooperative, enthusiastic and interest in learning vocabulary. Therefore, it can be said that anagram plus flashcards is a good strategy of learning that could be apply on every subject of lesson, especially in English. 5.2. Suggestion In line with the conclusions, there five points would be suggested as follow: 1. For Headmaster, this research can be a source for school, not only English teacher but also for all the teacher. 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">The Background of study</head><p>English as one the language in the world is very important to learn because it can be used in giving or receiving information and for the development of education, technology, and arts. Prepare a young learners to study English as early as possible is very crucial because their brain and memory is ready for learning and most them can learn quite well.</p><p>To develop students' language skills in reading, speaking, and writing, the learners must master vocabulary. The mastery of vocabulary cannot sometimes reach optimally. In reading, for instance, the students will get difficulties in comprehending the text if they do not know the words in the text. Similarly in speaking, they will have the same problem if they only have few vocabularies.</p><p>Vocabulary need to improve the four language skills, namely listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Without grammar, very little can convey, without vocabulary nothing can convey. When we just learn about grammar without learning vocabulary, we cannot express anything. It shows that English has a special place in the teaching of the foreign language at school, especially junior high school.</p><p>Vocabulary is central to language and of critical importance to typical language learner. Without a sufficient vocabulary, one cannot communicate effectively or express his ideas in both oral and written forms. It is clearly states that learning vocabulary is very important and becomes a must for every learner to make his English has a special place in teaching of the foreign language at school, especially junior high school.</p><p>In reality it is difficult to learn vocabulary. Vocabulary is one of the main problems often is faced by students in learning English. Based on the researcher's experience when did a field teaching practice program (Program Pengalaman</p><p>Lapangan: PPL) in PAB 4 Sampali, students are not interested in learning vocabulary and do not also give their full attention in the task and without that attracting and interesting the process of teaching vocabulary can not run well. This situation happened because the methodology or the strategy which is used maybe not suitable.</p><p>The teacher has still used old method in teaching English vocabulary, most of the teachers teach English vocabulary through translation, they usually apply too many words and ask the students to translated and then to make a sentences by using the given words. She/he usually gives many words to the students and asks them to open their dictionary to find the meaning of those words, after finding the words, they forgot. In fact, the students may become confused and discouraged in the process of learning. The students feel that they are forced and they would got bored.</p><p>It is not easy to teach vocabulary to the students because most of them are not interested in learning English so that they are lazy to memorize some words in English and finally they can not master vocabularies in daily word. This situation happened because the method and strategy which are used not suitable.</p><p>Based on the researcher's observation in the first grade at MTs PAB 1</p><p>Helvetia, it happens from the technique that used in learning. The technique in teaching vocabulary is monotonous; the students just memorize the changes of verbs, the word related to nouns, adjectives, and adverbs. There are many technique and methods of language teaching that can be selected for teaching vocabulary.</p><p>One of the solution to solve this problem is by applying anagram. Anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. All the letters of the name or phrase must use once and only once. This is the basic rule of anagramming. Flashcards are interesting and colorful which can motivate students.</p><p>Flashcards can use to explain language meaning and construction, engage students in a topic, or as a basis of whole activity.</p><p>The researcher thinks that it can make the students interest in and relax in order to motivate and encourage them in learning vocabulary. It means that after learning vocabulary by using anagram plus flashcards, the students will expect to be able to increase their vocabulary in a friendly way and it will be very interesting and challenging. That is why the writer want to conduct a research with the title</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THEORITICAL REVIEW</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Theoretical Framework</head><p>In conducting a research, theories need to explain some concept or terms apply in the research concern. Some terms use in this study and they need to be theoretically explain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Vocabulary</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.1">Definition of Vocabulary</head><p>Vocabulary is all the words that a person knows or uses. The verse above shows that human can do communication after they know the names of the whole things in the world. We can see from this verse that Allah taught Adam names of all things. The names of all things mean vocabulary in English subject. All people will have good ability in English if they have many stocks of English vocabulary because they will be able express their idea precisely and can do communication well with other people.</p><p>The verse also describes the teaching process that has given by Allah to Prophet Adam for the education process firstly. It means that education has been exemplified by Allah from the first creation of man. So, the first of the verse shows that man was created in a state of not knowing anything. Learning vocabulary can see from the process teaching as Allah taught Adam the names of the whole things when education is as process that must exist in human life. Allah SWT has prepared man the ability to call out words from names of the things. It's fact that man can communicate well if they know the names of everything.</p><p>And also the verse shows that education and learning is very important because education is as a process that must be exist in human life. Moreover, now days, learning is very important part to talk about, of course include learning vocabulary inside.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.2">The Importance of Vocabulary</head><p>The importance of vocabulary are :</p><p>a. Vocabulary is a basic part of reading comprehension. Simply put, if students don't know enough words, they are going to have trouble understanding when reading. If there are too many words the students don't know, comprehension will suffer. The content of textbooks is often challenge enough.</p><p>b. Vocabulary is a major part of almost every standardized test, including reading achievements tests, college entrance exams, and armed forces and vocational placement tests. Test developers know that vocabulary is a key measure of both one's learning and one's ability to learn.</p><p>c. Studies have indicated that students with strong vocabulary are more successful in school and one widely known study found that a good vocabulary, more than any other factor, was common to people enjoying successful careers in life. Words are in fact the tolls not just of better reading, but of better writing, speaking, listening well. The more the student have vocabulary will effective their communication can be.</p><p>d. In today's world, a good vocabulary counts more than ever. Far fewer people work on farms or in factories. Far more in jobs that provide services or process information. More than ever, words are the tools of reading, speaking, writing and listening. A solid vocabulary is essential for both of these skills. 9</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.3">Kinds of Vocabulary</head><p>Vocabulary refers to words we use to communicate in oral and print language.</p><p>In order to communicate effectively using oral and print language, we must be able to flexibly use words that we recognize and understand. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Oral vocabulary is the set of words for which we know the meanings when we speak or read orally. Print vocabulary consists of those words for which the meaning is known when we write or read silently. Print vocabulary comes to play an increasingly larger role in literacy than does the oral vocabulary.</p><p>Vocabulary is divided in two kinds, they are receptive vocabulary and productive vocabulary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Receptive vocabulary</head><p>Receptive vocabulary is that set of words for which an individual can assign meanings when listening or reading.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Productive vocabulary</head><p>Productive vocabulary is the set of words that an individual can use when writing or speaking. They are words that are well-known, familiar, and used frequently. 11 <ref type="bibr">9</ref> . Sherrie L.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.4">Vocabulary Mastery</head><p>A good vocabulary is a vital part of effective communication. A command of many words will make you a better writer, speaker, listener and reader. Studies have shown that students with a strong vocabulary and students who work to improve a limited vocabulary, are more successful in school. A good vocabulary more than any other factor was common to people enjoying successful careers. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Nation proposes the following list of the different kinds of knowledge that a person must master in order to know a word are: These are known as types of word knowledge, and most or all of them are necessary to be able to use a word in the wide variety of language situations one comes across. The different types of word knowledge are not necessarily learned at the same time, however. As we have seen, being able to use a word in oral discourse does not necessarily entail being able to spell it. Similarly, a person will probably know at least one meaning for a word before knowing all of its derivative forms. Each of the word-knowledge types is likely to be learned in a gradual manner, but some may develop later than others and at different rates. From this perspective, vocabulary acquisition must be incremental, as it is clearly impossible to gain immediate mastery of all these word knowledges simultaneously. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> The students' vocabulary will expand by:</p><p>1. Reading-novels, newspaper or magazines, 2. Exploring websites, 3. Watching films or video, 4. Listening to the radio, songs and audio books. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> The assumption cover various aspects of what is meant by knowing a word:</p><p>1. Knowing a word means knowing the degree of probability of encountering that word in speech or print. 4. Knowing a word entails knowledge of the underlying form of a word and derivations that can be made from it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Knowing a word entails knowledge of the the network of associations</head><p>between that word and another words in the language.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>13</head><p>. Jack C. Richards, <ref type="formula">(2000</ref> 6. Knowing a word means knowing the semantic value of a word.</p><p>Knowing a word means knowing many of the different meanings associated with a word. 15</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.5">Teaching Vocabulary</head><p>Teaching is helping other people learn. It is one of the most important ways that people relate to one another. Teaching helps people acquire the knowledge they need to become responsible citizens, to earn a living, and to lead useful rewarding lives. Teaching also transfers knowledge from one generation to the next. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Vocabulary have in common is the fact that vocabulary knowledge requires not only word meanings knowledge, but it requires the usage of the words in the appropriate context and in a natural way and also includes the relationship between new words acquired and the ones already acquired. Therefore, teachers should use strategies that teach the meaning of words in context and help students associate the new vocabulary learned and what they already knew and help students memorize the words and their meanings.</p><p>The student should be able to recognize words, and know their meanings as well. Thus, when a student is effectively able to recognize and use a word in different contexts, speak, write, pronounce the word well, she/he has the knowledge and meaning of that word. 17 <ref type="bibr">15</ref>  Pupils were encouraged to enter the new vocabulary learnt both inside and outside the classroom into their word banks or vocabulary. Pupils were invited to share with the class the words they had got from time to time. Positive feedback was given to pupils who added new entries on their own initiative. During the learning process, pupils were also encouraged to refer to their word banks to help them complete the learning tasks.</p><p>The tryout experience showed that active use of word banks was an effective way to help pupils gather new words at their own pace for their own reference as well as retrieve or recall the words they need in writing. By managing their personal word banks, pupils learnt to acquire self-management skills as well as study skills. They were thus able to develop good learning habits for life long learning. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Vocabulary is too often focused on unusual words encountered in novels, short stories or other materials students are reading in class. In story doesn't mean that most people need to know them. Certainly, a teacher should point out the meanings in the context of the story, but having students memorize definitions of words. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> The knowledge of word meanings and the ability to access that knowledge efficiently are recognized as important factors in reading and listening language comprehension and use. Additionally, Barra suggests that to comprehend a text successfully students need to have sufficient word knowledge. This is to say that the comprehension of a language depends on the amount of words that are known in that language. Also, students need to have sufficient word knowledge to understand what they read. Students can understand a writer's message only if they know the meaning of most of the words used in a text. Without knowledge of the key vocabulary in a text, a learner may have serious trouble in understanding the message, that is, word knowledge is crucial to reading comprehension and determines how well students will be able to comprehend the texts they read. So, having students with a large amount of vocabulary knowledge is essential to language comprehension.</p><p>In addition, vocabulary helps students with language production. Hubbard states that the more words a student knows the more precisely that student can express the exact meaning he/she wants to. Based on this view, to communicate effectively students need to know a large number of word meanings. Likewise, Cardenas states that vocabulary is used to determine the proficiency a student has in oral context. This is to say that vocabulary is an essential component to determine how much a student is able to communicate successfully. So, students have to overcome the lack of vocabulary knowledge in order to communicate effectively.</p><p>Language teachers should focus on effective instruction to teach vocabulary to help students to develop their vocabulary knowledge in order to communicate successfully. However, the focus of the instruction was not always on the vocabulary. So, the next section is intended to provide a brief background of vocabulary instruction. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> </p></div>

There were improvement of the students' achievement from 56,41-76,72 about 20,31 point and that score (76,72) was excelled the indicator (75).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Conceptual Framework</head><p>Vocabulary is one of the basic elements in mastering English. Vocabulary plays a very important role in learning language because without vocabulary proficiency, the students automatically can not obtain the four skill of English, such as listening, reading, speaking, and writing.</p><p>In obtaining the four skills of language, teacher must use an effective technique in teaching vocabulary. Anagram consider as an affective, enjoyable and interesting way to teach vocabulary because it can give the students enjoyment or challenge in studying language and encourage them to look carefully at words, students can practice to form other words from the given clues. Match word with definition, provide spelling practice, show the students how the letters of many words can manipulate to form others words, emphasized the importance of letter position in relation to word meaning.</p><p>It is clear that anagram is an interesting way of learning to increasing one's vocabulary, anagram technique plus flashcards can motivate and encourage the students' interest learning vocabulary. Flashcards are interesting and colorful which can motivate students. Flashcards can uses to explain language meaning and construction, engage, students in a topic, or as a basis of whole activity. The combination between technique and media that is interesting can improve the students' comprehension in learning so the new vocabularies can accept easily by 25 students. The procedure of teaching that will be used in this research as follows:</p><p>preparing yourself (media, and teaching materials), setting the class, showing the flashcards, discuss in the group and doing the exercise, giving some clues of difficult words that related to the material, and asking the students to complete vocabulary task.</p><p>Therefore, teaching and learning process through anagram plus flashcards will aim to improve students' vocabulary mastery. It means that by using anagram plus flashcards both teacher and students will help to overcome their problem in teaching learning process.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The Research Design</head><p>This research method was designed in a Classroom Action Research.</p><p>Classroom action research is useful for the teacher to improving the process and the quality of learning in the class. By using steps in classroom action research, teacher can find the problem solving in their class and the problem solving. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> Classroom action research consisting of three words that could be understood as follows understanding.</p><p>-Research -examine the activities of an object, use the rules of a particular methodology to obtain data or information useful to improve the quality of a thing that interest and important for researchers.</p><p>-Action -something movement activities that are deliberately made with a specific purpose, which study form a series of cycle of activity.</p><p>-Class is a group of students who are in the same time receiving the same lesson from a teacher. Restriction written for the understanding of the nation that class in long, to knock out a misconception and is widely understood by public with " the room where the teacher". Not a form of classroom but a group of students who were studying. <ref type="bibr">27 Kunandar, (2008)</ref>, Penelitian Tindakan Kelas, Jakarta: Rajawali Pers, p. 41</p><p>The writer uses a classroom action research design by Kemmis and McTaggar in Arikunto model. The cycle contains four phases; they are planning, acting, observing and reflecting. 2. Action, thinks and considers what action will be done, how strategy will be applied, and what material will be provide 3. Observation, is some activities that consist of gathering data to identify the result of action. Collecting data can be considered from several factors: students, teacher, interaction of students and teacher. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The Procedure of Collecting Data</head><p>The procedure of collecting data conducted six meetings for two cycles. Each cycle consist of three meetings and involves four phases, namely planning, acting, observing and reflecting.</p><p>The application of four phases of action research in the classroom as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Cycle I</head><p>The cycle I apply by using these steps:  Action is the process of doing, it is the implementation of planning. So, in this phase, research conducts to everything that has been planned in teaching and learning process Observing In this phase, researcher observes all the situation or conditions that happened during the process of teaching and learning. Reflecting Reflecting is the feedback process from the action that has been done. From the result of observation, researcher analyzes the problem that exists, finds the cause of the problem and make a conclusion</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">The Location and Subject of The Study</head><p>This research conduct in MTs PAB-1 Helvetia locate on Veteran Street Pasar IV Helvetia Labuhan Deli, academic year 2016-2017. The subject of this study conduct in class VII-C MTs PAB-1 Helvetia. There are 48 students in the class. They are 24 girls and 24 boys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Instrument of Collecting Data</head><p>In this proposal, the instrument for collect the data use pre-test and post-test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Pre-test</head><p>In the testing process, the students have to read a passage silently and answer ten questions related with the text given. This test also intended to have general description about the English skills of the students. The result of the test became the evaluation before the retelling strategy is applied in the class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Post-test</head><p>The students instruct by the different strategy. The students have taught by the teacher by applying retelling technique. The test is given after the students read silently the passage that is same with the first passage and retell what they had read in the written form. From the score of this test, the researcher intend to know how about the improve of the students' vocabulary mastery. The result of the scoring then compare with the pre-test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">The Technique of Collecting Data</head><p>In collecting data, the research used:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Observation</head><p>The researcher observe the student' and the teacher's activities during teaching learning process. In observing the implementation the strategy, the writer apply an observation sheet. The process of observation was done during the action of the scenario of teaching learning process in the first and second cycle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Interview</head><p>The researcher interview the English teacher and the students to know their opinion about the material and implementation the strategy. Interviewed was done before implementation the strategy and after implementation it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Tests consisted of multiple choice</head><p>The researcher uses test to get the data result about process of learning reading skill. The tests are pre-test and post-test I and pre-test II. The form of the test is multiple-choice items. It is to evaluate their skill in vocabulary at first. On the other hand, the post-test is implemented after using retelling technique. The test is held on the end meeting in each cycle. I control all the students when doing this test and the students involved this research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Study documentation</head><p>Study documentation use to show the teaching and learning process by using the photograph. I took the picture when they were studying. It can show them that are serious or not when learning and teaching process and document in this research was used to understand the curriculum or teaching-learning process that have been implemented by the English teacher. The document was taken such as lesson plan, students' vocabulary score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Technique of Analyzing the Data</head><p>The study apply qualitative and quantitative data. The qualitative data are analyzed from the interview sheet, observation sheet, test and study documentation.</p><p>The qualitative data use to describe data while the learning process in the classroom.</p><p>The quantitative data are use to analyze the score of the students, the researcher observed their activities by using anagram plus flashcards that given to the students. Quantitative data is broadly used to describe what cloud be measured or counted.</p><p>In this study, the data obtains from some sources. They are students' text book, a teacher and the students. The observer observes the students' action while the use of technique and also the students' opinion about the retelling technique in vocabulary. In this study, the data gather are obtains some sources.</p><p>The first, to know the mean of the students' score for each cycle, the researcher applied the following formula:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>∑ 100%</head><p>Where:</p><p>= The mean of the students' score ∑ = The total score of the students N = The number of the students <ref type="bibr">28</ref> Second, the writer tries to get the class percentage which pass the minimal mastery level criterion (KKM) considering English subject which is adapted from the school agreement at MTs PAB-1 Helvetia. It uses the formula:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P = 100</head><p>Where: P = the class percentage F = total percentage score N = number of students</p><p>The criteria of success of part are by using observation sheet. The result of this observation will be seen the percentage.</p><p>After getting mean of the students' score per actions, the researcher identifies whether or not there might have students' improvement score on vocabulary comprehension from pre-test up to post-test score in cycle 1 and cycle 2. In analyzing that, the researcher uses the formula:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">The Data Description</head><p>The researcher got the data from class VII-C at MTs PAB-1 Helvetia about the factual conditions of the problems faced by the teacher and students in teaching and learning English especially vocabulary. The researcher gave the pre- test that consist of 20 questions multiple choice to know the students' ability at memorizing vocabulary. All of students present in pre-test, it can be seen in table 1 follow: Based on the pre-test, the total score of students was 2210 and the number of students took the test were 48, so the mean of students' score were = = 46.04</p><p>From the analysis above, the students' ability at memorizing vocabulary was low. The mean of the students was 46.04. Then, to the percentage of students who passed the KKM score, the researcher used the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P = 100% P = 100% P = 8.33%</formula><p>Based on the result of the pre test, there were only four students or 8.33%</p><p>of the students who got the score above the Minimum Mastery Criterion (KKM) meanwhile the 44 students were below that criterion. From that analyzing, it could be seen that almost of first grade of MTs PAB-1 Helvetia students' vocabulary was still very low. Therefore, it needs to find out the solution to overcome this problem. The researcher used anagram plus flashcards in teaching vocabulary as an innovation in teaching learning process. Then, the researcher continued to the first cycle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">Cycle I</head><p>In the cycle I consist of planning, action, observation, and reflection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Planning</head><p>In this cycle, there are three meetings which were conducting to the students. The researcher prepared materials that thaught containing of. The researcher gave students some questions to provoke students to talk and find out the level of students' skill in English language. In this phase, the researcher made a planning based on the problems faced by students about vocabulary. The researcher had done prepare some planning, for the first is the researcher must know about the students problem at memorizing vocabulary in the classroom, after the researcher know the students problem, the researcher making the lesson plan for the meeting in cycle I. after that the researcher have to analyze the text book that used in the school. Next, the researcher has to prepare material and media in teaching vocabulary. After that, the researcher prepares the instrument of the research for example observation sheet to observe the students, pre-test as instrument to collect the data about the students' problem and post test to know there are some students' improvement score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Acting</head><p>The researcher had done some cases in the action step. The researcher implemented anagram plus flashcards technique in teaching learning process and the researcher Had done all of the procedures of the acting, the first implemented the teaching learning process based on the lesson plan. After the researcher implemented the teaching learning, the researcher asked the students understanding about the lesson. Next, the researcher introduced the students how to used anagram plus flashcards in learning vocabulary. And then, the researcher gave new vocabulary about things to answer by students. After the researcher gave new vocabulary about things, the researcher gave clue and some card of new vocabulary each question than the students answered from the clue and card. The researcher asked the students to pronounce the answer, the difficult words and translating them. After that, the researcher asked the difficulties to the students during teaching learning process. After finished teaching learning process, the teacher gave the students test vocabulary namely multiple choice test based on the previous topic that was learned. And the last, the researcher made the conclusion of the lesson.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Observing</head><p>The observation activities conducted the class VII-C, the researcher implemented anagram plus flashcards technique to increase students' vocabulary in learning process. During the action, the researcher observed the learning from the began activities, how to manage the process of learning and organizing the students.</p><p>Based on the report of observations of teaching, some of the things that should be observe by the researcher for the first one, Checked the observation sheet by checklist the observation format, Took the diary notes, analyzed the classroom and wrote all of the action that happened in the classroom. It was done to know the students' interest in learning vocabulary by using anagram plus flashcards and To knew the increasing of students' vocabulary by using anagram plus flashcards.</p><p>Next, to know students' ability, the researcher gave them the test consist of 20 questions in multiple choice. The result of post test it can be seen in table 2: Based on the post test I of the first cycle, the total score of students was 3290 and the number of students took the test was 48, so the mean of students' score was = = 68.54</p><p>From the analysis above, the students' ability at memorizing vocabulary was low. The mean of the students was 68.54. Then, the researcher calculated the class percentage that's passed the Minimun Mastery Criterion (KKM), using the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P = 100% P = 100% P = 45.83%</formula><p>The data showed that the mean score of post-test 1 was 45.83%. There were 23 students or 45.83% of the students who got the score above the Minimum Mastery Criteria (KKM), meanwhile the other 25 students were below that criterion. It implied that the first criterion has not fulfilled. So, post test of the first cycle was categorized unsuccess. The second cycle will beb conducted by the researcher.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Reflecting</head><p>Based on observation in learning of increasing students' vocabulary that imply by using anagram plus flashcards technique. There are increasing from the students' ability at memorizing vocabulary after using anagram plus flashcards technique. It can be seen from the result of pre-test score until the post test 1 score.</p><p>After teaching and learning process by using anagram plus flashcards technique in cycle 1, the researcher observed that there are some cases to be fixed in the cycle 2 to make this research perfectly, they are the students' ability at memorizing vocabulary should be improved and the teacher should take care to the students who has less confidence, so they brave to expand their idea. It needs to revise the acting and planning before implement to the next cycle so that it could achieve the criteria of success of this study. So, the researcher had to move to the next cycle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">Cycle 2</head><p>The first cycle was started at the first meeting until the third meeting. In cycle 2, the researcher was expected that the result from the students was better than the first cycle. Similar to the first cycle, the researcher conducted to the second cycle with the same steps. In the cycle 2 consist of planning, acting, observing and reflecting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Planning</head><p>In this cycle, there were three meetings which were conducting to the students. The researcher prepared materials that thaught containing of. The researcher gave students some questions to provoke students to talk and find out the level of students' skill in English language. In this phase, the researcher made a planning based on the problems faced by students about vocabulary in cycle I.</p><p>The researcher had done prepare some planning, the researcher making the lesson plan for the meeting in cycle II. After that the researcher prepare the post test II as instrument to collect the data about the students' problems at memorizing vocabulary. Next, the researcher has to prepare material and media in teaching vocabulary. After that, the researcher prepares the instrument of the research for example observation sheet to observe the students, post-test II as instrument to collect the data about the students' problem. And the last is the researcher created more supportive condition in order to foster the students to give more their responses and their participation actively in the class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Acting</head><p>The researcher had done some cases in the action step. The researcher implemented anagram plus flashcards technique in teaching learning process and the researcher Had done all of the procedures of the acting, the first implemented the teaching learning process based on the lesson plan.

After that, the researcher asked the difficulties to the students during teaching learning process. After finished teaching learning process, the teacher gave the students test vocabulary namely multiple choice test based on the previous topic that was learned. And the last, the researcher made the conclusion of the lesson.</p><p>a. The teacher gave the students test vocabulary namely multiple choice test based on the previous topic that was learned.</p><p>b. The researcher made the conclusion of the lesson.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Observing</head><p>In cycle 2, the condition of the class was very well after implementing anagram plus flashcards technique. All of students became actively to the activity given by the researcher so the atmosphere of class make the students interested to follow the lesson. The next step the researcher collected the data from post-test 2.</p><p>To know students' ability, the researcher gave them the test consist of 20 questions in multiple choice. The students' ability from the post test 2 can be seen in the following table. Based on the post test 2, the total score of students was 3750 and the number of students took the test was 48, so the mean of students' score was = = 78.12</p><p>From the analysis above, the students' ability at memorizing vocabulary was improved. It can be seen from the mean of the students was 78.12. Then, the researcher calculated the class percentage that's passed the Minimun Mastery Criterion (KKM), using the following formula: P = 100% P = 100% P = 77.08%</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Reflecting</head><p>In this phase, the feedback of the teaching learning process was taken from the result of the observation. As the observation and result the test, the researcher could be concludes as follow:</p><p>a. The research could be increased the students' ability in vocabulary by using anagram plus flashcards technique.</p><p>b. Students' score had improvement too. It was based on the percentage of the students' score. It made the researcher felt that the cycle could be stopped because the students could master in vocabulary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Data Analysis</head><p>From the result of analysis showed that there was a development on the students' ability at memorizing vocabulary. it showed from the mean of pre-test was 46.04, the mean of post test 1 was 68.54, and the mean of post test in cycle 2 was 78.12.  The result of percentage of students master during the research showed that percentage of students master improved in each test. In the pre test there were only 8.33%or four students. It was caused the teacher did not give the treatment to the students. In the post test I there was the improvement of percentage of students was 45.83% or 22 students, and in the post test II there were 77.08% or 37 students. In the cycle II, not all the students got point up to 75 but there were not get good point. Even though they did not get point up 75, their score kept improving from pre test until post test II. It was caused in this cycle the researcher still applied anagram plus flashcards technique and explained it more detail, and also did some additional activities that were based on the reflection done by the researcher and collaboration to prevent the same mistakes in cycle I and to get better improvement of students' score. Researcher motivated students to generate their interest in learning English.</p><p>From the data, it indicated that using anagram plus flashcards technique at memorizing vocabulary was effective, and the data above can be concluded that the students' ability have been improved by using anagram plus flashcards technique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">The Interpretation of the Data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">Data of Observation</head><p>The researcher observed and investigated the students, the situation and the problem or obstacles found during teaching learning process. Observation sheet was used to measure the level of students' activities during teaching and learning process in which anagram plus flashcards technique was applied students' activities and behaviour students' ability in vocabulary and interaction between teacher and students. The result of observation during the research can be seen in Appendix. The data gained from first observation before CAR and after CAR.</p><p>From the observation sheet, the researcher noted that the students were active and enthusiastic in learning vocabulary by using anagram plus flashcards technique. It seen from their enthusiastic and interested in the lesson while the teaching learning process and the increasing of their understanding and memorizing from their score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Data of Interview</head><p>The interview was done before conducting the first cycle. The reseacher interviewed the teacher and students. The interview also was done after implemented the technique to the teacher and some of students. From the studentss and teacher's answer in interview, showed that the researcher felt the learning process was more active and the students' ability were increasing also.</p><p>From the students in interview pointed thet they pleasure and enjoy learned vocabulary by using anagram plus flashcards technique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3.">Data of Diary Notes</head><p>Diary notes were written up by the researcher in every meeting during conducting the reseach. From the diary note, it was found that the students were active and enthusiastic during the teaching learning process. Even though, some of students were lazy to learned vocabulary, but when the researcher applied the anagram plus flashcards technique, they felt interested and enjoy in study vocabulary. So, in this research, students showed the improvement in learning vocabulary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.4.">Data of Test</head><p>Based on the result of students' vocabulary score, it was found out that the students' vocabulary score was improving.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Research Finding</head><p>The finding of this research is that anagram plus flashcards technique can help the students' ability at memorizing vocabulary. By applying this technique, the score of the students in vocabulary kept increasing from the pre test until post test in each cycle. It was proved by the data which showed that the average of the students in the post test II (78.12) was higher than the post test I (68.54) and also higher than pre-test (46.04). Anagram plus flashcards technique was applied to increase the students' vocabulary. Used anagram plus flashcards was one of many strategies that could make the students easier in learning English especially in vocabulary.</p><p>This improvement not only happened in the mean of students' score but the expression, interest, and excitement of students showed that there was improvement. It can be seen in the interview and observation sheet. Most of the students were more active and enthusiast during teaching learning process. It implied that the use of anagram plus flashcards could increase the students' vocabulary and also help the English teacher to teach vocabulary.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thursday, February 9 th, 2017 (Meeting 1)</head><p>It was the first meeting. The condition of the class at that time was noisy because the students thought that the researcher was a new English teacher. To handle that situation, the researcher introduced herself and informed the purpose of her coming. of the research was pre-test. During the test, many of them seemed difficult to do the test because they did not have good preparation. They really very surprised gave a test for them and prohibited them to read the dictionary and work cooperatively. Some students were busy to do other activities, made noisy, and didn't do the test seriously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wednesday, February 15 th, 2017 (Meeting 2)</head><p>It was the second meeting. That was the first of teaching-learning process begun. The researcher prepared all the materials needed. The researcher explained about shopping list, anagram technique and showed the flashcards. The researcher asked the opinion of the students about the material. In the previous day, the researcher had done the interview with the teacher and some students after school. The researcher found that there are some problem that were faced by the students. The students mostly did not understand about the teacher's instruction and explanation because the teacher always taught the students in English.</p><p>Therefore, the writer used English and Bahasa Indonesia in the teaching and learning process to have all the students understood about the lesson. Many of them wanted to participate in that especially the braver students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thursday, February 16 th, 2017 (Meeting 3)</head><p>It was the third meeting with the students, they still be taught about the shopping list.</p><p>The researcher opened the class with greeting and told about the lesson before. The researcher asked the one or two students to put the pictures of shopping list on the blackboard. When the researcher explained the material, they listened. Some of students were mention the wrong pronunciation while they asked to read the word in blackboard, so the researcher gave correction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wednesday, February 22 th, 2017 (Meeting 4)</head><p>After evaluated the students work in cycle I, many of the students failed the test, therefore, the teacher reflection and identified the problems that the students faced learnig.</p><p>Here the researcher found the students get difficulties in reminding vocabularies. Finally in the fourth meeting, the teacher reviewed to teach about shopping listin more detailed and gave more examples with anagram.</p><p>During the lesson, all of the students paid much attention to the teacher's explanation and intruction. In the end of the lesson, the teacher intructed them to make shopping list and using anagram technique in group and discussed it together.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thursday, February 23 th, 2017 (Meeting 5)</head><p>In this meeting, before started the lesson the teacher greated the students. The teacher gave them apperception by asking them about a new vocabulary and how to said. Then the teacher asked them to sit in group and gave them one topic to discuss through anagram</p><p>Technique. The students were enthusiast and more active in doing the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thursday, March 2 nd, 2017 (Meeting 6)</head><p>This was the last meeting. The researcher held the test for the last time. The students looked confident with their ability. After the test done, the writer interviewed the teacher and the students that had been interviewed before. The teacher admitted that there were some improvement with the students, consisted their enthusiasm to study English, their positive feedback, and their positive attitude. The teacher agreed that anagram plus flashcards could help the process of teaching and learning and could be combined with other activities that would make the teaching and learning process become more interaction and enjoyable. At last, the English teacher and the students held some kind of farewell party by giving a few words to say goodbye and stated their hope to the writer. It was a touching moment for the writer.  The researcher : What do you think about the class Miss?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix</head><p>Miss Sita : Well, some of the students are great but most of them are in trouble with their English.</p><p>The researcher : Would you mind to tell me why ?</p><p>Miss Sita : It happen for many reason but generally because they have lack of vocabulary. I always use English during the teaching and learning process to make English as a habit, but they cannot follow the lesson well because of that lack of vocabulary. The other reason is maybe they do not consider English as a need yet, that is why they have not give so much effort in studying English.</p><p>The researcher : In relation to the lack of vocabulary, what do yoy think the solution to solve that problem ?</p><p>Miss Sita : By continue teach them by using English and giving their vocabulary list.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Interview with the students</head><p>1. Interview with the first students Miss Sita : I have seen some differences. The students are now able to make the new words from one word or picture and they are very enthusiastic to study English. I believe that it is a good improvement and hopefully it will not stop just right after you leave.</p><p>The researcher : What do you think about the flashcards media that I have applied in your class?</p><p>Miss Sita : I think it is helpful in case of improving students' vocabulary achievement. I agree that a teacher should have technique and media during teaching and learning process. It is impossible for the students to master a lot of vocabulary in one occasion. By applying anagram plus flashcards, the teacher will have their authority to choose what words should be taught and be the most important. In the other side, the students will be able to obtain some vocabulary consciously and they also do it accidentally while reading. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>5 .</head><label>5</label><figDesc>For readers this research can be read to enrich their knowledge about anagram plus flashcards. i ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS In the name of Allah, the most gracious and the most merciful.

It is clear that anagram is an interesting way of learning to increase one's vocabulary. There are many kinds of word game, such as scrabble and puzzle. Anagram is faster paced and more productive than those word games because anagram is focusing on word formation and vocabulary expansion through the use of affixes and compounds. Among its many beneficial features are the following: a. Can be played for fun or specific language study. b. Valid for any level of language learner. c. Can be played competitively and cooperatively. d. Involves consonant attention and full concentration.</figDesc></figure>

Chameleon is a animal which has ability to change its skin color e. Leopard has freckle in all of its body and have relationship with tiger 3. The student omit one or some letters of the key word and transpose the rest. For example: a. Key word : be ran Definition : a dangerous animal likes honey New word : bear b. Key word : be lam Definition : young sheep New word : lamb 4. The students transpose the letters of the word and form another word by using those letters exactly once based on the definition. For example : a. Check in Definition : the animal produce many egg and people kept as a pet Word : Chicken b. A got Definition : the animal has relationship with sheep. It has beard Word : Goat 5. The student write in the blanks the names of things hidden in the words and phrases appropriate to the clue By applying the fifth ways of anagram to the students, it can create livable atmosphere in the study of English vocabulary. It can also create more fun learning activities in classes.</figDesc></figure>

There are essential step of learning vocabulary: a. Getting a clear imagine for form of the new words b. Learning the meaning of the new words c. Making a strong memory connection between the form and the meaning of the new words d. Using words Teaching vocabulary is a very important field. And it is more than just presenting and introducing new vocabulary to the learners. Vocabulary can be presented, explained in all activities and experienced in all manner association. It means that vocabulary should be applied in all activities. It used when we are speaking, listening, writing and reading. The more vocabulary possessed by someone, the better chance she/he has of mastering the language skills. It means that the words can be used in the students' daily life. Almost student feel difficult in mastering vocabulary because it is very hard for them to memorize a long list words. That's why, teacher should use different techniques and activities in teaching in teaching English vocabulary to motivate the learners, enrich their vocabulary and enable them to speak English properly.
