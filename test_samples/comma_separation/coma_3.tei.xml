<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Significant of the Study</head><p>The result or findings of the study will be significant to those who want to masters the procedures of writing a narrative. They also provide information about the difficulties or even errors in producing the texts. Teacher and lecturers can learn something valuable about the students' problems in writing a narrative. The problems identified in the study can be used as a reference to design a syllabus or curriculum for writing skills.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Theoritical Freamework</head><p>Terms are used clarify the concepts in a research. The following are explained and elaborated to avoid confusion in the discussion of the research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Method</head><p>Method is a word that refers to the means to be used to achieve a goal that is expected. If it is associated with the learning process, the learning method definition can be interpreted as a way chosen by educators to optimize the learning process that aims to achieve the expected learning goals. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Each class may be the possibility of using different learning methods with other classes. For that a teacher should be able to apply various methods of From the verse above, Allah asked the human to give the lesson by wisdom, wisdom means the way by the right method. It can help the teacher to make teaching learning process run well.</p><p>There are varieties of strategy that can be used to support cooperative learning in the classroom. Such strategies include Jigsaw in reading skill, Think- Pair-Share to develop speaking skill and Round Robin Writing for writing skill.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Image Streaming</head><p>Image streaming is a mental exercise for the purpose of visualizing an event which has been stored in the memory. The subconscious memory contains information which can be used to solve the problems encountered in life. Image streaming is believed to rises the level of intelligence because of the stored information. It can also create a vision in the mind which leads to the ability to make plans. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> In other words, the process of Image Streaming is like flow of pictures created in the mind. The activity can draw the subconscious powers of the mind to solve problems of any kind in life such as the problems of writing narrative paragraph. A narrative consists of some elements which should be well understood in order to produce a coherent story.</p><p>The important thing from this method is to describe the experience upon experience and observe it, so we simply do not know and aware that the experience was there. Actually, we do not only stay awake and alert for our perception, but also broaden and deepen our perception by the feedback from our own description. The entire process is interesting perception deeper into the conscious focus. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> With the technique of describe or explained the goal of our learning answers become part of what is specified quickly and easily, and part of what has been pulled into the full focus of our conscious thinking. <ref type="bibr">Let</ref>  Basically, to drain the shadows is seen, and then find any shadow chance to play in the "Mind's Eye" at the time described clearly or with a tape recorder. It is very different to determine consciously chosen shade. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> This method is a bland of theory Socrates and Einstein's theory. Where</p><p>Socrates theory known as pervasive understanding the principles of the theory ofSocrates is to describe the perception of thing to the listener or tape recorder with a view to be able to perceive more. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Socrates developed a system which is able to simulate the audience to speak. Socrates encourage students find the world a much broader and deeper by investigating perceptions of their exterior and interior and describe what they found. One of the systems Socrates was asking detailed questions that provoke students to investigate and describe their perceptions on the answer. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The teacher is not aware that the active constituent of the Socratic methods is not a "question" but rather as a result of the questions that simulate people to think and work. While Einstein's theory is derived from the basics of visual thinking, vision contain more information and more information through hearing.</p><p>Kinesthetic feeling proved to be also very important in relation to our mental experiences. According to the EEG (Electro-Encepha-Lographic), eight percent of our brain areas involved in visual response more than other senses. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Nearly all visual responses created in eighty percent of the area of the brain turned out to coincide with our unconscious brain area. Data stored there or other factors that precluded can appear (bring yourself) on the visual response. It looks like the emergence of a variety of factors unconscious on one's mind in a test of ink blobs Roarsach though involve external vision. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> That is why large discoveries in science and technology usually produced by the help of visualization.</p><p>Brain activity is the simulation of brain activity by means of stimulation of brain waves. Brain activity aims to stimulate the whole brain to the fullest and to balance the functions of the right brain or left brain. Left and right brain each have a different potential, although crossing between the two parts of it were still there.</p><p>The left brain function in matters related to logic, reason, the ability to write and read as well as a center of mathematic. Some expert said thatthe left brain is a center Intelegent Quotient (IQ), while the right brain function in development of the Emotional Quotient (EQ). For example, socialization, communication interaction, and emotional control.</p><p>There are two type of sensory memory thathas been widely studied by psycholinguistics namely the iconic and echoic memory. An iconic memory recording system senses to visual information (picture and concrete object) through the eyes of example the latter 'A'. A person is expected to see between 9- 10 objects or items of 12 possibilities, iconic memories fade so quckly and dissappear whitin half and second later.</p><p>Echoic memory is a recording system that operates whitin the human hearing. Stimulus processed form of the sound coming in through the sense of the 13 Ibid, p. 296 ear. There are two kinds of recording senses of hearing, namely Short-term storage, the storage simplest soon dissapear in less and a seconds latters after the stimulus hear abolished. Long-term storage, the information that was heard disappeared a few seconds letter after hearing stimulus abolished. 14 Broadly speaking, given the power or memory capacity of each person can be improved at least use can be optimized through exercises and specific strategies.</p><p>The advantages of image streaming method are asfollows:</p><p>1. Increase visual thinking skills and help direct visualization.</p><p>2. Increase neural connections with what is being studied by visualization in context so that more distant from the abstract.</p><p>3. Repair or build a foundation of understanding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Generate immediate inspiration and always . 15</head><p>The disadvantages of Image Streaming methodasfollows: a. Requires a relatively long time in the applicability b. Not all teachers can employ this method, teachers are in demand can bringing the atmosphere of students into the realm of deeper, so the teacher less able to master class this method is less effective at doing.</p><p>c. This method must be done in a conducive and quiet, not effectively done in a hectic because it requires tranquility. The image streaming method can be performed in the following ways:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Ask yourself a question:</head><p>A question is asked to provoke a kind of image in the mind. A question elicits some information which can be later described.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Start the image stream:</head><p>A live listener is provided with a tape recorder. Students will sit back, relax, close his eyes, and describe aloud whatever images that appears in the mind.</p><p>Students than goes with the first, immediate impression and describe them aloud in a rapid flow and sensory details. More free image will than emerge.</p><p>Students will notice when the scene change or other image merge, and describe these as well.</p><p>It is important to describe aloud and bring the mind images into conscious awareness, no matter how unrelated the images which first appeared. This process helps bridge the separate regions of the brain. There can be surprising images. More pictures surprising that students see in their mind's eye, it will get better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Feature -Questioning:</head><p>Pick out some one feature-a wall, a tree or bush, whatever's there. Imagine laying a hand on that feature and studying its feel (and describe that feel), to strengthen your contact with the experience. Ask that rock or bush or wall,  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">What's the Same?</head><p>Examine whatever's the same among the several sets of images when all else is different. These themes or elements-in-common are your core answer or message.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Relate</head><p>Go back to your original question and determine in what way or ways these core elements are the answer to your question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Debrief</head><p>Summarize this whole experience either to another person (directly or by telephone) or to notebook or computer. This change of medium, and change of feedbacks, should add further to your understanding. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> It can be concluded that the method of image streaming is the unification between Socrates and Einstein's theory. Namely Einstein's theory combines the visualization of mind by allowing the images to the brain with the free following With the application of such methods is expected knowledge, students can improve their understanding of critical thinking in the classroom and more established and strong belief in the teachings of Islam and practice it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Writing</head><p>Generally, writing is needed as a medium through which people share what they have in mind. According to McDonald and McDonald, writing is usefully described as a process; something which shows continuous change in time that should be developed and trained continuously. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Meanwhile, Langan said that writing is a process of discovery that involves a series of step, without practice, people can think the writing is difficult. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Based on the explanation above, it shows that learning writing is assumed to be difficult and the students should develop a full understanding of the writing process so they are able to express themselves more confidently, effectively, and efficiency in order to create a piece of writing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Genre of Writing</head><p>Genre is a kind of text or writing work itself. It views that the language (writing form) must be related to social function. Social function of the text then implies a certain social environment and place where and when the text is used. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> There are various genres of text: Narrative, Descriptive, Procedure, Recount, Explanation, Analytical Exposition, Hortatory Exposition, Report, Anecdote, Spoof, Review, and News.</p><p>From the variety of genres above, the writer choose the genre of narrative to be applied in writing.</p></div>

The paragraph describes either an actual event or a fictional one that the writer creates. Narrative paragraph usually follow in chronological order, taking the reader from the beginning of the event to the end. Transitional words, such as "later" or "then", give the reader a clue about how the events progressed.</p><p>Narrative paragraph usually communicate some sort of moral or ideal so that readers come away feeling that they have learned a lesson. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> Generic structure: Example of narrative paragraph:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Paragraph</head><p>A paragraph is a group of related sentence that presents a unit of thought.</p><p>Paragraphs provide organization and focus to a piece of writing, breaking up information into manageable chunks for readers. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> Paragraph is also a unit of text that develops one idea or topic in spesific detail. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> According to Bob Brannan, paragraph is collection of related sentence that are clearly connected to one other and that make some point. Paragraphs come in several varieties: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.1.The Topic Sentence</head><p>A paragraph should have only one central idea. A topic sentence (also known as a focus sentence) encasulates or organises an entire paragraph, and students should be carefur to include one in most of students major paragraph.</p><p>Although topic sentence may appear anywhere in a paragraph, in academic essay student often appear at the begining. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> In the other words topic sentence is the main idea of a paragraph.</p><p>A good topic sentence is the sentence which can be well developed by some supports. Commonly it is not about a general truth that is common to everybody. It must be an opinion which needs to be proved. It is not too long write in a short text containing about five to ten sentence. It is not also too short to write. A good topic sentence must be interesting to attract the readers' attention. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.2.The Supporting Sentence</head><p>A paragraph's topic sentence should be accompanied by a series of sentence that develop, explain, or illustrate. These other sentences are called supporting sentence. <ref type="bibr">29</ref> Supporting sentence are the development of the main idea.</p><p>A paragraph is well-developed when it contains specific details that help explain and illustrate the controling idea when readers have all the information they need to make sense of the paragraph. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> The supporting sentence which directly develops the topic sentence is called the major supporting sentence. The one which indirectly develops it but directly develops the major supporting sentence is called the minor supporting sentence. All the supporting sentence of a paragraphs are about the topic sentence. <ref type="bibr">31</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.3.The Concluding Sentence</head><p>A primary purpose of concluding sentence is to get readers out of students' paper. A concluding sentence leave the main point in the end of the paragraph. 32 It usually uses a conclusion transition signal in the end of the essay such as: in conclusion, in summary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.4.Unity</head><p>Every idea discussed in the paragraph should be adequately explained and supported through evidence and details that work together to explain the paragraph's controlling idea. If you have a sentence that is not directly related to your main topic, your paragraph is concidered to "lack unity" or the sentence is "off topic" and should be removed from the paragraph. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> Unity only discuss one idea in one paragraph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.5.Coherence</head><p>Paragraph should aslo be coherent. Coherence means estabilishing a relationship between the ideas the ideaspresented in a paragraph. <ref type="bibr">34</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.6.Transitions</head><p>The use of transitions (also called "connectors" in the text) is the most common technique for creating coherence in writing. Transitional words and phrases guide a reader through our writing like street sign helps us to find our way in the city. <ref type="bibr">35</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Writing Narrative Paragraph</head><p>Writing narrative paragraph guide the students step by step through the process of writing a paragraph about an experience they have had. There are some steps to write a narrative paragraph as follows:</p><p>1. Prewriting: activities help students think about experiences they have had and the people, events, actions, and conversations that took place during those experiences.</p><p>2. Writing: activities help students write a topic sentence that gets the reader's attention, body sentences that narrate the event, and an ending sentence that draws the paragraph to a close.</p><p>3. Revising: activities help students check the time-order in their paragraphs and use a checklist to make improvements.</p><p>4. Editing: activities help students use the right word and check for other errors.</p><p>5. Publishing: activities help students create a clean final copy of their paragraphs and reflect on what they have learned.</p></div>

According to Brown there are five scoring components scale name: content, organization, vocabulary, language use and mechanics. <ref type="bibr">36</ref> Those specific criteria are described in detail in the following stages:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Components</head><p>Criteria Score Level</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Content</head><p>The score of content depend of the students' ability to write ideas, information in the form of logical sentence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Excellent to very good</head><p>(Knowledge substantive, development of topic sentence, is relevant to and assigned topic.)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fair to poor</head><p>(Limited knowledge of subject -little substance-etc)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="21">-17</head><p>Very poor    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Framework Thinking</head><p>Writing is one of the language skills that should be acquired when learning language. Learning about writing is not only about how to put words in written but also how to pact the idea, massage, and information correctly in a text, in a certain criteria. A narrative is a story that is created in a constructive format (as a work of speech, writing, song, film, television, video games, photography or theatre) that describe a sequence of fictional or non-fictional human event.</p><p>Narrative often contains a chronological sequence of event, but some narratives contain only a single event or skips around in time.</p><p>The teacher can use some strategies in teaching writing narrative. One of them is by using Image Streaming method. In using this method, students are asked to imagine the sequence of the story that they want to write and will be easily to write the story step by step. For the achievements, they will be able to produce a good narrative text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Hypothesis</head><p>The research hypothesis is formulated as follows: Helvetia Medan. The reason to choose this school based on the researcher's experience during doing teaching at that school, research finds the students have difficulties in writing, especially in writing narrative paragraph.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H 0 = "</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Research Design</head><p>This study was conducted by using experimental research. In this research, the sample was divided into two groups, namely experimental group and control group. The experimental group wasused Image Streaming method while the control group will be used the conventional method. </p></div>

The Data This study was conducted by applying an experimental research. There were two groups in this research, namely experimental and control group. This research applied a writing test which the total score is 100. The pre test was given before the treatment and the post test was given after the treatment. The researcher gave the treatment to students in the experimental group by applying Image Streaming method while control group without applying Image Streaming method. From the data were collected the lowest score of pre-test was 40, and the highest score of pre-test was 66 and the mean of pre-test was 53.46. On the other hand the lowest score of post-test was 66, and the highest score of post-test was 88 and the mean of post-test was77.26. Whereas in control group, showed the lowest score of pre-test was 40, and the highest score of pre-test was 60 and the mean of pre-test was47.66. On the other hand the lowest score of post-test was 56, and the highest score of post-test was 80 and the mean of post-test was 69.53 (See Appendix I, J).</figDesc></figure>

I set off to explore the jungle and I brought some food, matches, ropes, and a flashlight on my knapsack. Next, I looked my tent and after I had walked for about 2 km, I was tired. Then, I found a steep slope. There was no other way so I climbed the slope. Suddenly, one of my ropes was broken and was hooked at a casuarinas tree. I screamed for a help but no one heard me. After a few minutes, I turned on my flashlight. A ranger saw the light and he saved me. He did the first aid and he asked me, "Are you injured?" I answered, "Yes, my back is in pain." "I will handle it." He bandaged my back. After that, he went to the base camp to search for a help. Not taking a long time, he got back with his friend and they carried a litter and put me on. When the morning came, they took me to the nearest hospital. I thanked them. It was a bad experience. I only slept and I thought of my injured back. The nurse asked me, "Are you okay?"

From the calculation above, the total of decrease from the pre-test and 

post-test in control group is 412. Meanwhile the mean of pre-test and post-test in 

control group is 12.73. 

So, the hypothesis testing in this research, it is used two average similarity 

test by using statistic, as follow: 

T-test = 



Where: 

x 1 = 23.80 

x 2 = 13.73 

S 1 
2 = 48.13 

S 2

From the calculation above, it can be seen that t observed = 5.754.The 

testing hypothesis is conducted in order to find out whether that hypothesis is 

accepted or rejected. The basis of testing hypothesis is that the H a is accepted if 

the t observed &gt;t table . In this study the calculation of the scores uses t-test for the 

degree of freedom 58 (df = N + N -2) at the level of significant 0.05 that the 

critical value is 2.009. So it can be seen that t table = 2.009.

My mom. She's a very kind women. She would stay awake all night when 

i'm sick, would scold me real bad when i make mistakes. She is a multi-talented 

woman who is my mother, cook, doctor, therapist, economist, Counselor priest, 

and an inspiration. I have no idea what else she can do, but somehow I feel like 

she can understand what and how I feel about things in my life even if i don't tell 

her anything. I feel like she can read my mind. She just needs to peek into my 

eyes and everything becomes clear to her. Even now she can do that quite easily. 

My silence speaks to her in a lot of ways i can't even explain.. her actions and 

gestures always direct me and indicate me if i'm wrong at some place. My mom is 

like a "Goddess of sacrifice" because he would sacrifice everything for us. I love 

my parents and I'm thankful to be their child. To be honest, all I have now 

is because of my parents and their blessings.
