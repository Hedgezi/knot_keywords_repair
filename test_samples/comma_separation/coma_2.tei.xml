				<p>There are various factors that can improve the quality of life of the population such as physical quality factor, the quality of non-physical factors and attitudes about environmental management. These factors are not only important in promoting improved quality of life of the population in sustainable development, but also as the dominant factor affecting the implementation of the political life, social life, the use of functions in ecological dimension and the implementation of applicable legislation.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Level of education</head><p>In a broad sense, Akhmad (2012: 73), Sri (2015: 1), and Aryati (2014: 13) stated that education is part of the life of society and the nation. Education is a conscious process of developing the human soul that allows humans to grow and improve in accordance with the ability and willingness of potentials of the individuals.</p><p>Desy <ref type="bibr">(2013: 105)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Ratna (2013: 149)</ref> stated that education can systematically develop one's methods of thinking so that it can be used to solve problems encountered in the workplace. Education can also be referred to as an effort to increase the general knowledge of a person, including a mastery of theories needed to decide matters concerning the activities of the achievement of organizational goals. Human capital will not arise by itself in the absence of a process of investment in education, both formal and informal.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Akhmad (2012: 73)</ref>, the function of education consists of two, namely; First, the micro function (narrow), education serves as a conscious help to the physical and spiritual development of learners.</p><p>Second, the macro function (large), education serves as personal, citizenship, cultural and national developments.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Eko (2013: 226)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Marshel (2013: 257)</ref>, education should be directed to produce humans who are able to compete, have noble characters and morals because planned, directed, sustainable education can help learners to develop an optimal ability cognitively, affectively, and psycho-motorically.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Hayati (2013: 153)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Putu (2013: 140)</ref>theoretically, the most representative institution is school. The reason is simple: because in school institutions all things; material taught, teacher, student, systems and methods of teaching and learning areasare designed for educational purposes. To produce qualified and characterized human resources, there should be a synergy between family, school, and community, because the character derives from a custom, the same way with sources of knowledge acquired from school. Given the role of formal education in schools is so broad, encompassing aspects of knowledge, skills, especially the socialization of values and attitudes in society, the level of education of a person can be measured by the education he gained from the school.</p><p>Because the school is so large role in shaping the knowledge of a person, such knowledge can be used as an asset. According to <ref type="bibr">Ratna (2013: 149)</ref>, the Human asset can be invested in schools, computer training course, expenditures for medical care, and tuition. The values of punctuality and honesty are some of the assets while improving health, increasing revenue or spending on education, training, medical treatment, are some of the assets investment. These result in qualified human resources, not a physical or financial results because skills, health or values require physical and financial assets.</p><p>Based on the previous description, the synthesis of the level of education in this study is: the length of formal education people get until it reaches a certain level of education where the public school is located. The longer a person get a formal education, he is increasingly isolated by the values that are relevant to changes in social values that occur in the community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attitudes towards the Change of Social Values.</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Livia (2014: 5)</ref>, Debra (2015: 98), <ref type="bibr">Retno (2014: 25)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Pardomuan (2013: 28)</ref>, and Netty (2014: 100), attitude is a form of evaluation or reaction to the feeling of the collection of aspects of the information and become a concrete form that produces action. Attitude can be learned, and can affect a person's behavior toward an object. In other words, the attitude can be interpreted as the tendency to respond a stimulus based on our assessment of the stimulus. The response can be either positive or negative. <ref type="bibr">Tahir (2014: 82)</ref> states that every attitude can be formed due to the influence and the role of one's nature and the environment, which both have the same function in the sense that the attitude is not carried from birth. Every individual has a reaction or attitude towards a particular object and this will become part of the attitude of the individual. There are five characteristics of the attitude, namely: 1) objects, 2) leads, 3), intensity, or equivalence, 4) structure, and 5) were studied. It is said there is an object because there is something to be addressed. No attitude emerges without an object. It is said to lead because every object has a direction. So attitude leads to the object addressed. It is said that it has an intensity because of the attitude shows how high or how low the response is. It is said to be structured because the attitude has components that are internally formed by itself, namely the intertwined cognitive and affective components.</p><p>Similar opinion conveyed by <ref type="bibr">Pardomuan (2013: 28)</ref> who says that attitude can be divided into three aspects: (1) Aspects of psychomotor is a motoric skill that includes not only physical activity, but also the activities coupled with the intellectual skills, such as writing, reading, using a microscope to observe certain bacteria, using a welding torch to connect pipes, and so forth; (2) motor skills is best achieved through repeated practice. In this case, teachers need to design learning strategy that can develop psycho-motoric aspects of students to improve the students' skills in general; (3) the last aspect that cannot be overlooked is the cognitive aspect. This aspect includes the ability to manage and develop the thinking process by recording, making analysis and synthesis. <ref type="bibr">Tahir (2014: 83)</ref> says that there is a difference between attitudes and values, although both are beliefs and cognitive. First, attitudes are beliefs about an object that are specifically related to a person or situation, while the value is general, in nature. Values are beliefs inherent with people, regardless of how others are while attitude is a response to other parties.</p><p>Social changes that occurred in an autonomous district is usually a change in the system of government in the form of division of the district. Such change may derive from the system of social values exist in the community such as the historical background and the demands of life, and some may derive from outside of the community such as the occurrence of contact or communication with the area and the laws of regional autonomy as proposed by some experts before.</p><p>Based on the previous description, the synthesis of attitudes about changes in social values is a trend that is done in regards to public expression towards the intensity and the direction of the reaction about the changes in social values, can be positive or negative, that occur in the community with regard to the area division. The tendency is seen from the public expression towards the belief in the division of the district; agreement or disagreement of the division, and a tendency to act about the area division.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</head><p>This study tries to explain a practical illustration based on the confirmatory concept. This process is done through various tiered causality patterns to view the quality of life of environmentally sound development in the construction of several districts of the division in North Sumatra in <ref type="bibr">2013 -2014</ref>. The study was classified as a survey with a sample of 2 240 households in seven districts taken randomly, namely: Langkat, SerdangBedagai, Nias Selatan, Batubara, LabuhanBatu Utara, Tobasa and Mandailing Natal.</p><p>The pattern of tiered causality tiered means looking at the effect of each factor on the formation of latent exogenous variable and latent endogenous variables to further examine the effect of exogenous latent variables either directly or indirectly through an intervening endogenous variable to the endogenous variables, at once.</p><p>This study involves four latent variables and fourteen factors variables expressed as Observatory variable, namely: Environmentally sound quality of life latent Variable (Y2), environmental management stance latent variable (Y1), the latent variable of non-physical quality (X2) and variable latent of physical quality (X1). Those four latent variables are established by each constituent variable called factors variable. Those fourteen factors variables are environmentally-sound quality of life latent variable (Y2) formed by factors variables of ecological quality (Y2.1), social quality (Y2.2), political quality (Y2.3), law quality (Y2.4). Latent variables stance on environmental management (Y1) is formed by factors variables of attitudes about the management of the natural environment (Y1.1), attitudes about the management of the social environment (Y1.2), attitudes about the management of the built environment (Y1.3). The latent variable of non-physical qualities (X2) is formed by factors variables of personal qualities (X2.1), harmony with the environment (X2.2), the quality of the community (X2.3), Quality of citizenship (X2.4). Latent variable of physical qualities formed by factors variables of economy quality (X1.1), health quality (X1.2) education quality(X1.3). A structure analysis offered in this study can be seen in the following scheme: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Findings and Discussion</head><p>The results of the analysis is shown in the following scheme: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality Of Residents' Lives In Autonomous Regions Of North Sumatra</head><p>This research obtains the following findings: 1. All the factors proposed by theoretical study were significant in shaping the latent variable of physical quality, non-physical quality and latent variables stance on environmental management as well as the latent variable on the environmentally-sound quality of life of residents 2. Factors making up the physical qualities do not have a direct dominant influence on the quality of life of residents of environmentally sound. 3. Factors shaping the quality of non-physical factor expressed as dominant factors which directly affect the quality of life of residents of environmentally sound. 4. Factors shaping the physical quality have dominant influences on the quality of life of the population of environmentally sound, only if these factors are collaborating with the factors that shape attitudes about the management of the built environment that goes with it. 5. Factors forming the non-physical qualities dominantly influence the quality of life of the population of environmentally sound, either directly or indirectly through attitude on environmental management and the accompanying factors</p><p>In addition to a finding of a number of the dominant factors that influence the quality of life of environmentally sound, the researchers also found determinant factors formed through determinant indicators, where the level of validity is determined based on the value of the greatest influence parameter. The analysis also shows that each of the determinant indicator has a relatively low value of scores compared to other indicators. As recommended by the law of Liebig, the quality of a system is determined by the state of subsystem / factors that are in a state of the minimum or the lowest. Based on the Liebig, the determinant indicators responsible for shaping the determining factors influence the changes in residents' quality of lives of environmentally sound, as follows: a. The factor of economic quality; determined by the access in getting a job/ business b. The factor of education quality; determined by the quality of formal and non-formal education of the communities c. The factor of Health quality. An indicator that needs a reduction is the number of illness or diseases which commonly attack the heads of the family. d. The factor of communities attitudes; determined by the emphasis on indicators of cognitive, affective and conative inherent in the population in regards to attitudes about the management of the built environment e. The factor of quality harmony with the environment; determined by indicators, environmental and ethical insights of community owned by the society f. The factor of political quality is one of the determining factors of the four dominant factors that empirically affect the establishment of environmentally-sound residents' lives quality. This factor is determined by the presence of the indicators which are the democratic and transparent political systems. The Following scheme is the findings of the research which can be used as a reference by the autonomous districts in North Sumatra to develop an environmentally-sound qualified life:</p><p>Picture. 3. Flow Chart of Study Results on theprocess of direct and indirect effect happens to physical and non- physical variables on the Attitude towards the management of made/built environment to the quality of residents' lives of environmentally-sound.</p><p>Annotation: = Indicator = determinant = Factor = Formed by = Latent Variable = Affect</p><p>The flowchart above is a series of the dominant factors that must be addressed immediately in order to improve the quality of the population to better move the wheels of environmentally sound residents' lives quality development in North Sumatra. Improvement of these factors is determined based on the minimal indicators that are very decisive and has been empirically proven as factors that determinedly influence the development of the quality of residents' lives of environmentally-sound in the autonomous districts of North Sumatra.</p><p>These obstacles lies in the economy quality factor caused by weak factors indicators: 1) the struggle level in finding business / employment, 2) health factors caused by the indicator of the level / degree where most illnesses suffered by the heads of families, 3) the education quality factor caused by the low quality of formal and informal educational backgrounds of the community, 4) factors of harmony with the environment as a result of lack of insight into environmental and ethical issues in the communities, 5) factors of attitudes about the management of the built environment caused by weak cognitive, affective and conative / psychomotor qualities, 6) the political quality factor caused by lack of system of democracy and transparency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The implications of Research</head><p>The implications of these findings can be applied to several programs as follows: 1. Determination of the basic policy should be directed to the improvement of the determinants indicators contained in physical qualities variable, such as improvements in the economic field, improvements in health, and improvements in education. Improvement of non-physical quality indicators can be done by building environmental and ethical insights in the communities. Determination of basic policy is inseparable from the role of government and representatives of the people in the House of Representatives, and therefore the level of the basic policy should have a political weight that the success indicator can be seen from the level of achievement which emphasizes the aspects of cognition and affection. 2. On the programming level, the training is still directed at domination in terms of cognition, particularly the perceptual patterned. The accuracy and precision of the perception of the man and the environment should be an absolute requirement. At this level of action, plans related to strategic levels are expected to turn out to be the attitude towards the management of the environment, naturally, socially and artificially. 3. The implementation of the program should be able to create groups that interact and complete each other.</p><p>The groups that will carry out the program are determined by the government and the representatives of Parliament and other groups associated with the results of the training itself.The Success will depend on the characteristics of each group in the interaction. Indicators of successful implementation of this program are seen from the three aspects; cognitive, affection, and cognation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>It takes some similarities to achieve a regularity of basic policies, strategic plans, operational plans and the implementation of coaching programs. These similarities include similarities in national insights followed by its objectives, common grounds regarding the use of the remaining facilities and resources that can be used to run the wheel of development, common attitudes, and opinions about ways to achieve goals in fostering environmental quality and the life quality of the population. The similarity of attitudes in environmental development should be directed at the importance of understanding the meaning of total sustainable- environmental developments while the similarities in population quality are more focused on shared political understanding that can give meaning to democracy in a transparent process. This commonality among others can be achieved by using clear and appropriate language to make sure that there is no change and difference of understanding in the process of diffusion from the most abstract to the most instructional level.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
