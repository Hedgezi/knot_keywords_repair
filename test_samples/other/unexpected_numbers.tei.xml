Introduction 

The 
Great 
Barrier Reef is a system of coral reefs extending 
for some 2000 kilometres along 
the 
north-eastern 
coast 
of 
Australia, 
from 
Cape 
Yo~k 
in the north (i0 
41'S) to just 
north of Fraser Island (24 
30'S) (Figure 
i). 
The 
Barrier 
Reef 
is 
not 
a 
single 
entity, 
but 
comprises 
some 
2600 
individual offshore reefs ranging in size from 
less 
than 
1 
hectare 
to 
more 
than 100 square kilometres. 
In some areas 
the reefs are separated by channels 
only 
200 
metres 
wide, 
while 
elsewhere they may be 20 kilometres apart. 
Most reefs 
remain submerged at all times, although some are 
exposed 
at 
low tide. 
Few reefs support vegetated cays. 

The Great Barrier Reef has been described as the largest 
and 
richest 
system 
of 
coral reefs in the World (GBRMPA, 1981). 
The need to ensure that the Barrier 
Reef 
may 
be 
used 
and 
enjoyed 
by 
future 
generations 
was 
reoognised 
by 
the 
Commonwealth Parliament through passing of the Great 
Barrier 
Reef 
Marine 
Park 
Act 
1975 
(the 
GBRMP 
Act). 
Further 
recognition of the Reef as a unique natural feature of global 
significance 
came 
in 
1981 
with inscription onto the World 
Heritage List. 

John 
Brewer 
Reef, 
located 
in 
the 
Central Section of the 
Marine Park, was chosen as the site for 
the 
development 
of 
the 
Four Seasons Barrier Reef Resort complex. 
72 kilometres 
across open water 
to 
the 
north-east 
of 
Townsville, 
John 
Brewer is the closest reef to this regional population centre 
and the focus for many reef related activities. 
For 
a 
long 
time 
the 
destination 
for line and spearfishing John Brewer 
Reef 
provides 
a 
safe 
anchorage 
for 
recreational 
and 
commercial fishing vessels. 
The only tourist use of the area 
prior to 1983 was fishing and 
diving 
from 
charter 
vessels 
based 
in Townsville. 
S4nce then, pontoons and an underwater 
viewing vessel have been installed at the Reef as part of the 
'Reeflink' 
day 
trip 
operation, 
serviced 
by 
a high speed 
catamaran. </table></figure>

Attached at a single point to the main mooring, the Hotel 
is 
able 
to 
swing 
into 
the wind during a storm to reduce wind 
resistance. 
The Hotel is also designed 
to withstand 
twice 
the 
force 
of 
the 
most severe cyclonic storm with a return 
period of one hundred years i.e. a cyclone with winds of 
162 
km/hr. 
In relatively calm weather the Hotel is held in place 
by two additional stern moorings. 

The 
main 
mooring 
is a similar design to those Used to moor 
super tankers in deep water and consists 
of 
six 
230m 
long 
chain 
legs laid out in a radial pattern, each attached to an 
18 tonne anchor at one end and the central 
counterweight 
at 
the 
other. 
The 
counterweight 
in 
turn is attached to the 
H%tel mooring boom through a series of 
joints 
and 
swivels. 
In 
total, the whole mooring system weighs 480 tonnes (Figure

referred for 

environmental 
consideration 

An environmental impact statement 
was 
commissioned 
by 
the 
proponent 
and 
completed in 1985 (Det Norske Veritas, 1985). 
Assessment of the EIS was carried out by the then 
Department 
of Arts, Heritage and Environment. 
The Department consulted 
with other Government 
Departments, 
particularly 
the 
Great 
Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and also took into account 
public submissions on the proposal. 
The assessment concluded 
that 
likely 
environmental 
effects 
of 
the 
proposal 
were 
appropriately identified and examined in the EIS. 

In 
summary, 
the major impacts of the proposal were expected 
to be: 

9 visual 
intrusion as a result of placing the structure into 
a natural environment; 

9 possible water and air pollution; 

effects on marine life due to moorings, divers' 
anchor 
damage, shading, lights, pollution and 
of boating traffic; and 

fin damage, 
the presence 

the possibility of accidents, particularly the grounding of 
the hotel itself. (Dept. of AH&amp;E, 1985) 

The Department also recommended conditions for the protection 
of the environment. 
These 
included 
the 
development 
of 
a 
resort 
management 
plan 
and 
an 
environmental 
monitoring 
program, as were offered in the EIS. 

Considering 
the 
degree of public interest in the Hotel, the 
EIS attracted little criticism. 
Only six public 
submissions 
were 
received 
in 
response 
to the call for comments on the 
proposal. 

Four of the submissions came from environmental lobby groups, 
three of which expressed the opinion that similar 
structures 
should 
not 
be permitted anywhere on the Great Barrier Reeff 9 
This stance, widely reported in the media, has centred on the 
philosophical 
and 
aesthetic 
argument 
that the ~wilderness 
value' of the Park will be compromised by the 
profile of the 
Hotel 
protruding 
above the horizon, considered to be a form 
of visual pollution. 
It is apparent that resolution of these 
arguements 
requires 
the 
preparation 
of 
broad 
strategic 
guidelines, to set limits on the extent to which developments 
will 
be 
permitted 
in the Marine Park. 
The setting of such 
strategic 
direction 
is 
clearly 
beyond 
the 
scope 
of 
an 
environmental assessment relating to an individual projectt 9 

Another criticism of the EIS was that a detailed inventory of 
the 
biological 
characteristics 
of John Brewer Reef was not 
includedd 9 
However, inclusion of such an inventory 
with 
the 
EIS 
would 
not have assisted assessment or management of the 
environmental impacts of the proposed operation 
and 
it was 
therefore 
not 
a 
requirementt 9 
Furthermore, changes to the 
biological make-up of the Reef 
will 
be 
identified 
by 
the 
Monitoring 
Program, 
rendering 
a biological 
inventory 
a 
superficial appendage to the EIS. outline of Permission Granted 

In December 1985, the Authority issued a permit 
to 
develop 
the 
floating 
hotel 
at John Brewer Reef. 
Conditions of the 
permit were based on 
the 
assessment 
of 
the 
environmental 
impact study and the Department's recommendations. 
Important 
requirements were that: 

the 
proponent 
develop 
and 
plan, 
to 
the 
Authority's 
consideration all legislation 

implement a resort management 
satisfaction, 
taking 
into 
applying to the proposal. 

the 
proponent 
develop 
and 
implement 
a 
satisfactory 
environmental 
monitoring 
program 
so 
that results of the 
program 
would 
assist 
management 
of 
the 
development, 
including 
amendment of the management plan if appropriate; 
and 

among 
insurance requirements, a AS1 million bond be posted 
to provide for removal of the structure at the cessation of 
operations, 
if necessary, 
or to counter any unacceptable 
environmental impactss 9 

test 
effects 
of activities which could not be assessed in 
the EIS; and 

9 provide 
a measure of the state of heaIth of the Reef biota 
adjacent to the Hotel site. 

The 
proponent 
was 
also 
required 
to undertake 
modelling 
studies to determine the rate of dilution of the brine 
plume 
arising 
from 
the 
desalination 
plant 
discharge 
and 
the 
dispersion characteristics of the incinerator 
and 
generator 
stack 
emissions. 
Further 
information was also required on 
erosion and sedimentation processes in the 
vicinity 
of 
the 
hotell 9 

Separate specific permits 
were 
issued 
for 
each 
stage 
of 
development, 
covering such activities as approved site works 
(cropping of coral outcrops), installation 
of 
moorings 
and 
ancillary 
pontoons 
and 
commencement 
of 
operations at the 
floating hotel. 
This 
staging 
of 
permissions 
enabled 
the 
Authority 
to set specific conditions based on the results of 
the further detailed studiess 9 

The 
general 
permit 
fox 
installation 
and operation of the 
hotel was re-issued in January 1988 
for 
a period 
of 
five 
years, 
incorporating 
changes made in the light of knowledge 
and events that had arisen 
in 
the 
two 
years 
since 
first 
issue. 
The Resort Management Plan and the Monitoring Program 

L~ were included as attachments. 
A summary 
of 
the 
; stages appears in

assessment 

Assessment 
of Post EIS Issues 

Some 
changes 
were 
made 
to the plan for the development in 
response to issues that arose after the 
EIS 
was 
completed. 
Among 
the changes, the Hotel site is not in exactly the same 
location as identified in the EIS. 
This is 
because 
further 
studies 
cast 
doubt 
on 
an initiai assumption that wind and 
waves would come from the same direction during a cyclone. 
A 
more 
sheltered site further towards the centre of the lagoon 
waz chosen to allow for the more severe condition of wind and 
w~ves 
coming from different directions. 
The minor change of 
site did not invalidate the EIS. 

Preparation of the new site required 'cropping' of more coral 
outcrops than 
envisaged 
in 
the 
EIS. 
However, 
as 
major 
modification 
was only required in the case of three bommies, 
the environmental impact of the cropping 
was 
judged 
to 
be 
within 
the 
broad 
scope 
of 
the 
original 
assessment 
and 
therefore did not warrant 
further 
investigation 
under 
the 
EPIP 
Act. 
Conducted 
with 
a pontoon-mounted back hoe, the 
cropping operations were controlled under a 
specific 
permit 
and 
were 
closely 
monitored, particularly for the impact of 
disturbed 
sediments. 
All 
live 
corals 
encountered 
were 
transplanted to a nearby area. 

The EIS envisaged that treated waste water 
would 
accumulate 
in the Hotel holding tank at an average of about 800 cu.m per 
week. 
This amount was to be transferred to a 
barge 
with 
a 
similar 
capacity 
once 
a week and discharged in a stream on 
the return trip to Townsville. 
In the event, 
the$~developer 
has 
chosen 
a contractor with a barge housing a much smaller 
tank capacity (80 cu.m.) and the 
barge 
must 
make: repeated 
trips to a dump site in order to drain the holding tank. 

Although treated, the nutrient content 
of 
the 
effluent 
is 
undiminished 
and 
staff of the Authority were concerned that 
currents should not carry effluent 
back 
onto 
the 
Reef 
as 
nutrient 
rich 
water 
is 
deleterious 
to coral health. 
The 
change of plans presented the Authority with the 
problem 
of 
nominating 
suitable 
disposal 
sites 
at 
the 
minimum 
safe 
distance 
from 
John 
Brewer 
and 
neighbouring 
reefs. 
Oceanographic 
researchers 
at 
the 
Australian 
Institute of 
Marine Science were consulted. 
The researchers were able 
to 
offer 
advice 
on 
suitable dump 
sites 
based 
on 
computer 
modelling of water current circulation. 
Waste dumping at sea 
also 
falls 
within the ambit of the Commonwealth Environment 
Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 and staff of the 
Authority 
were consulted in drawing up conditions for the permit issued 
under this Act. 

An 
anti-scalant 
and 
a flocculant chemical are added to the 
desalination plant feed water to prevent fouling 
of 
osmotic 
membranes 
essential 
to. the 
desalination 
process. 
These 
chemicals are discharged back into the Reef lagoon 
with 
the 
hypersaline 
water, 
in 
concentrations 
of 
a 
few parts per 
million. 
Toxicity of these reactive organic polymers was not 
discussed 
in 
the 
EIS 
and 
the 
developer 
was 
asked 
to 
investigate the 
matter. 
Further 
investigations 
concluded
