				<p>IMPROVING STUDENTS&apos; READING COMPREHENSION BY USING CONCEPT ORIENTED READING INSTRUCTION AT MA TAHFIZHIL QURAN ISLAMIC CENTRE EKA DAMAYANTI PASARIBU 34.13.3.140. Instruction can improve the students&apos; reading comprehension. The subjects of this research were ten grade students of MA Tahfizhil Quran Islamic Centre. This research was conducted by using classroom action research. This research was usedpre-test and post-test data, interview sheet, observation sheet, and diary note data. The result of this research showed that there was improving of students&apos; reading comprehension. The mean of the pre test was 50.5, the mean of the first cycle was 70.3 and the mean of second cycle was 80.1, they showed that the mean in second cycle were better than the first cycle. The percentage of students who got point 75 up also grew up. In the pre-test, there were five students who got point 75 up. In the post-test of cycle I, the students who got point 75 up there were 16 of students (61.5%). It means that there was an increasing about 61.5%. In the post-test of cycle II, students who got point 75 up were 21 students (80.7%) and the increasing was about 19.2%. For the total increasing of the students&apos; score from pre-test to post-test of cycle II was 80.7%. In other words, the students&apos; reading comprehension improved from the first meeting to the next one. For the hypothesis testing, it was used t-tes formula from the computation, it could be seenthat coefficient of t-table (2.06) with fact level Î± = 0.05 was 7.626 in thecoefficient of t-observation (7.626) &gt;t-table (2.06). Thus, alternative hypothesis (Ha)stating that Concept Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) could improve the students&apos; reading comprehension and could make the classroom activities alive and active. 34 PERNYATAAN KEASLIAN SKRIPSI Saya yang bertanda tangan di bawah ini : Nama : EKA DAMAYANTI PASARIBU ACADEMIC YEAR&quot; Menyatakan dengan sebenarnya bahwa skripsi yang saya serahkan ini benar merupakan hasil karya saya sendiri, kecuali kutipan-kutipan dari ringkasan-ringkasan yang semua telah saya jelaskan sumbernya.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Background of the Study</head><p>Reading is one of the communication skills that should be acquired by students. Students are expected to get knowledge, information and understand about the context that has been explained in the text. In the other words, reading must be comprehended by the students.</p><p>In 1999, the Office of Educational Research and Improvement of the U.S.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Department of Education is the Rand Reading Study Group (RRSG), RRSG</head><p>began its thinking by defining the term reading comprehension as the process of simultaneously extracting and constructing meaning through interaction and involvement with written language. It consists of three elements: the reader, the text, and the activity or purpose for reading.</p><p>Based on the observation that has been done by the writer at MA Tahfizhil QuranYayasan Islamic Centre the writer found problems from the students and the teacher. The first problem is occur from the students at ten grade senior high school in the class IPA, the researcher get the data from interviewing the English teacher at MA Tahfizhil Quran Yayasan Islamic Centre the students can't understand the text well because they lack of the vocabulary, need too long time to understand the text, and do not know how to make the conclusion from the text.</p><p>The second problem is occur from the teacher, the researcher get the data from interviewing one of students at MA Tahfizhil Quran Yayasan Islamic Centre teacher only used the traditional method in teaching reading. The teacher just read the text and discuss it with the whole class, until the students did not have time to</p><p>share about the text freely. This condition made the students have low motivation in reading activity. Finally, their grade in reading were not good.</p><p>They are many way that can be used to solve the problem above. One of the ways is Concept-Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI), an instructional program that merges reading strategy instruction, conceptual knowledge in science, and support for student motivation.</p><p>The CORI program is designed to foster reading engagement and comprehension,through the teaching of reading strategies, teaching of scientific concepts and inquiry skills, and its explicit support of the development of student intrinsic motivation to read. "Concept-Oriented Reading Instruction," to reflect the central position of conceptual knowledge in teaching reading comprehension.</p><p>CORI has two main aspect (a) support for the cognitive strategies for knowledge construction during reading, and (b) support for the motivational development of learners. These two aspects are both served by teaching to contents or concepts in a discipline.</p><p>Thus, in order to make the students comprehend the text, the writer was very interested in conducting a study with the title "Improving The Student's</p><p>Reading Comprehension By Using Concept Oriented Reading Instruction Strategy MA Tahfizhil Quran Yayasan Islamic Centre".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Identification of Problems</head><p>Related to the background, the writer can identification the problems of the students reading comprehension as follow :</p><p>1. Most of the students need too long time to understand the text.</p><p>2. Most of the students get difficult to understand the text because they are lack of vocabulary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Most of the students lack of concentration</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Formulations of Study</head><p>In background of the research, the writer specifies the research in improving the students' reading comprehension in the ten class A grade senior high school at MA Tahfizhil Quran Yayasan Islamic Centre. The formulations of the problems are:</p><p>1. Can Concept Oriented Reading Instruction strategy (CORI) improve the students to understand the text well?</p><p>2. What are the students' responses used Concept Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) strategy by the teacher in teaching reading comprehension?</p><p>3. How the process in applying Concept Oriented Reading Instruction strategy in teaching reading comprehension?</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REVIEW OF LITERATURE</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Theoretical Framework</head><p>In doing a research, the term used must be clarified in order to have a clear perspective of the implementation in the field. The term may function to give a limited concept which is specifically meant in a particular context. By doing so, the research will be free from unnecessary interpretation of the readers. In this case it is very important to list the following terms for the purpose of the research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1. Reading</head><p>According to Alderson reading is an ability to understand the meaning of what is written and ability to form an appropriate of the message. Alderson defines reading by saying that reading involves perceiving the written form of language either visually or kinaesthetically. 1 Based on theory of Alderson reading is an ability in understanding the meaning of the text and ability to get the accurate information from the text or context which involved the visual and cognitive process.</p><p>So, based on the theory above, it can be concluded that reading is an activity to analysis and to understand in order to get the information from a text or a context which involved both the visual and the cognitive process. Reading is improving our knowledge and developing our vocabulary, by reading we will get the information that we need in our life.</p><p>In Based on the above verse, it is clear that we as Muslims are encouraged to read. This is because reading certainly add to our knowledge even by reading we will find out about the truth. In addition, the word of "Iqra" in the verse above is repeated twice. It means that we have to read so that we have knowledge and know our situation in this universe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1.1 Reading Classification</head><p>There are three kinds of reading:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Reading Aloud</head><p>In reading aloud, the students will get experience in producing the sound, which should be practice as many as possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Silent Reading</head><p>Silent reading is reinforcing the readers to find out the meaning of the words. Speed reading used to improve speed and comprehension in reading. This skill must be contiguous with the main purpose of reading that is comprehension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1.2 Level of Reading Comprehension</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Mohammad (1986)</ref> there are three levels of reading comprehension:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Literal Comprehension Level</head><p>Comprehension at this level involves surface meaning. At this level, teacher can ask students to find information and ideas that are explicitly state in the text. In addition, it is also appropriate to test vocabulary. In this level the reader will understand the text literally, the reader will get the information from the text explicitly. Literal reading comprehension is appropriate to test students' vocabulary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Interpretive or Inferential Comprehension</head><p>Inferential comprehension refers to the ability of a reader to take an information that is inferred or implied within a text. Inferential comprehension is more sophisticated than literal comprehension because it requires the orchestration and manipulation of information from the text as well as information that resides within the readers their background knowledge. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> In this level the readers will take an information from the text implicitly. They will comprehend the text based on their paradigm. Based on the theory above the writer can conclude that in reading to search information the reader typically scan the text for specific word to get the information that they are need, andin reading to skim the reader not read the whole text word for word, the reader can use signpost and clues to give some background information. Signpost is used to skip the material which they are not need and to sort the information which they are need.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>Reading to learn from texts Reading to learn typically occurs in academic and professional context in which a person needs to learn a considerable amount of information. Reading to learn is usually carried out at a reading rate some what slower than general reading comprehension. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Reading to learn means read the text to learn some materials which the reader want to know and to get the knowledge, reading to learn typically occurs in academic and professional context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.</head><p>Reading to Escape</p><p>Reading to escape happen when the people read the novel. Sometimes this type called genre fiction, includes in expensive and mass produced works of entertainment that people read to while away their time or ease their stress. There is nothing wrong with some relaxing reading for pleasure, so that why this purpose reading seldom in applying to the academic world. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Reading to escape means that read the text to entertainment the readers, in reading to escape the reader will read novel and short story.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2. Reading Comprehension</head><p>Comprehension occurs as the reader builds a mental representation of the text ( <ref type="bibr">Perfetti et al., 2005</ref> the topic of the text. 11 Based on the Perfetti theory comprehension occurs if the reader can build a mental representation of the text which they are need.</p><p>Comprehension is the way to construct the process in understanding the text.</p><p>Comprehension is the essence of reading and the active process of constructing meaning from text. Reading comprehension is a complex interaction among automatic and strategic cognitive processes that enables the reader to create a mental representation of the text. Comprehension depends not only on characteristics of the reader, such as prior knowledge and working memory, but also on language processes, such as basic reading skills, decoding, vocabulary, sensitivity to text structure, inferencing, and motivation. 12 Based on the theory above the writer can conclude that there are some elements in comprehending the text, the elements are follow :</p><p>â¢ The reader who is doing the comprehending</p><p>â¢ The text that is to be comprehended</p><p>â¢ The activity in which comprehension is a part. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Reading comprehension is the process of making meaning from text. The goal, therefore, is to gain an overall understanding of what is described in the text rather than to obtain meaning from isolated words or sentences. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> So the writer can take the conclusion that reading comprehension is not just a saying words but also the process in understanding the whole of the text. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Different sound</head><p>While the students are asked to read the text, the teacher will assess them by hearing their pronunciation or the sound that the students may say.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Paraphrase recognition</head><p>Paraphrase recognition means that the students are able to develop the main idea by using their own words. The teacher will assess them by looking at the way of they develop the main idea and also coherency between the main idea with supporting idea.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Information transfer</head><p>The teacher assess the students' reading comprehension not only through their pronunciation, but also how they transfer the information to others. 16</p><p>Based on Turner theory above it can be conclude that in asses the students' reading comprehension there are some aspect that can be used by teacher, they are: the students' pronunciation when they are read the text, the students ability in developing the main idea from the text by using their own word, and the students ability in sharing the information which they have got from the text, the students share the information to the others.</p><p>Based on the academic goals determining the students' reading comprehension of getting information from the text, the minimum score of standard competency is 75. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> The teacher will successful in teaching reading if the students' can get score 75 in reading comprehension subject.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.5. Concept Oriented Reading Instruction strategy (CORI)</head><p>Guthrie and his colleagues (1998) implemented a classroom intervention to emphasize conceptual instruction in reading and science called Concept</p><p>Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI). Concept Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) is an instructional program that merges reading strategy instruction, conceptual knowledge in science, and support for student motivation. Motivating students by providing choices and control.</p><p>Instruction that integrates conceptual themes with reading instruction is called Concept-Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI), because concepts direct the teacher's and the students' goals for reading.</p><p>The CORI practice of using knowledge goals in a conceptual theme is motivating, but it is also likely to support strategy development because it enables strategies to be used in a rich domain of interesting information. Therefore, strictly speaking, we claim that these practices are engagement supporting because they build internal motivations and foster cognitive strategies simultaneously.</p><p>Obviously, the strategies may also be seen as motivational because they encourage and engender the development of internal motivations for reading activities. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> The technique of CORI is easy to apply, this is based on Daniel McNamara books which quoted by the writer.</p><p>In applying Concept Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) students read a variety of materials in order to answer questions they have asked about various topics. At the same time, students are taught how to search for information in the text and to use that information to answer their questions. Students using this approach appear to gain both strategic and conceptual knowledge. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> So the writer conclude that Concept Oriented Reading Instruction is an instructional program that merges reading strategy instruction, conceptual knowledge in science, and support for student motivation. CORI is an strategy which can used for teaching reading, CORI is useful to motivate the students in reading the text, the students not only can read text but also can understand the whole of text easily.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.5.1 Phases in Concept Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI)</head><p>Furthermore, Concept Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) moves through four phases :</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Observing and Personalizing</head><p>To create a context for the motivation of curiosity, aesthetic involvement, challenge, and self efficacy in reading, we attempted to enable students to observe and think about the concrete, tangible objects and events in the real world around them. Students participation and choice in selecting the subtopics, goals, and materials for learning were emphasized.</p><p>We expected that sustained work on a conceptual issue of personal interest would enable students to enrich their conceptual knowledge and to learn increasingly complex reading strategy. The main point of this phase of instruction was to support students in developing and expressing their interest about the world around them. This phase also include bringing background experience and knowledge into learning and exploring processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Searching and Retrieving</head><p>Students were guided to learn how to search for subtopics related to their general interest and to search for informative resources, such as books, and opportunities for futher real world observation, which extended their knowledge and satisfied their curiosities. Students acquired concepts of their choices they would be motivated to form increasingly higher order observations and generalizations about the theme they were studying. This instructional dimension emphasized the cognitive strategies that students need to pursue and satisfy their explicitly stated topical interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Comprehending and Integrating</head><p>This portion of the instructional framework encompassed the comprehension strategies of determining the topic of a textual selection, detecting critical details, summarizing the text, making comparisons between texts, developing criteria for evaluating a book, and critically reflecting on the author's point of view and presentation of information. Within this instructional dimension we embedded the objective of connecting literary experience to conceptual understanding. Teacher wanted students to be able to identify plot, character, setting, and theme in narrative and literary works such as novels, folktales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Communicating to Others</head><p>Many exciting educational programs contains high expectation for communication. Students were expected to identify important information, to organize the information into coherent form, and to express their ideas precisely and convincingly. Students were expected to establish criteria, to develop a critical stance toward texts. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> The major aim of this instructional dimension was to enable students to express their understanding about topics of personal interest in a variety of coherent, persuasive, and accurate communications to classmates or other audiences of their choosing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.5.2 Implementation in Concept Oriented Reading Intsruction (CORI)</head><p>There are three parts in implementation Concept Oriented Reading</p><p>Instruction (CORI) in teaching reading comprehension stated on D. Ray Reutzel quoted by Nena Syahrani Syahaf Nasution 21 . They are explained in follow:</p><p>Before reading</p><p>1. Teacher activities students' background knowledge about the topic, through demonstration, video, pictures, objects, or other real object;</p><p>2. Teacher involves students in self questioning about the topic of study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>During reading</head><p>1. Teacher and the students read the text together: teacher read aloud, or choral reading. There will be a rich discussion and interaction around the text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Students search a variety of text about the topic. For additional question</head><p>and answer to question. 2. Student share through the use of poster, diagram, group projects, and oral report what they have learned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>After Reading</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Related Study</head><p>The studies that have relevant with this study are :</p><p>1. This strategy had been used by ResyOktadela <ref type="formula">(2014)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Conceptual Framework</head><p>Reading is one of the communication skills that should be acquired by students. Students are expected to get knowledge, information and understand about the context that has been explained in the text. One of strategy that can improve students' reading comprehension is Concept Oriented Reading</p><p>Instruction CORI, CORI is an instruction program that can be motivated the students to read a text and to get the information from the text.</p><p>Concept Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) can help the students to increase their ability in reading comprehension. Through the instruction in CORI the students can be motivated to be more active in the class. This instruction overcome students' difficulties in getting some interesting message or information of reading text and also give the teacher easily to prepare the material and comprehensive in their teaching reading comprehension.</p><p>Based on the statement above, Concept Oriented Reading Instruction as a strategy of teaching reading that can help the students in learning English especially in learning reading comprehension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Hypothesis</head><p>Based on the conceptual framework above, hypothesis in this research is formulated as follow : " Concept Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) can improve the students' reading comprehension at ten grade MA Tahfizhil Quran</p><p>Yayasan Islamic Centre.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Acting Phase</head><p>In this step, the researcher was implemented the activities of teaching reading in the lesson plan. The researcher conducted two cycle in this research.</p><p>Each cycle consisted of two meeting and each meeting was taken about 2x45</p><p>minutes. The step of implementation stage was divided into three sections. These were opening section, main activity section which cover pre-reading, whilst reading, and post-reading and closing section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Observing Phase</head><p>Observation is observed outcome or impact of the actions taken or imposed against the student. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> In this step, the observer took a note for every event that occurred in the classroom in order to get accurate data to repair next cycle. It held when the classroom action research is in progress. And in this step the English teacher as the observer will observe students' understanding, students' participation, students' activity, and students' comprehension in the teaching-learning process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Reflecting Phase</head><p>After carrying out the teaching process, the researcher recited the result of the activities which occurred in classroom as the reflection of the action. The researcher evaluated the process andthe result of the implemented of the CORI strategy that used in the reading class. It is a basic consideration to make plan and conduct the next meeting. It would also used to answer the hypothesis that has been proposed by the writer before the action is carried out.</p></div>

This cycle consisted of four steps similar to the first cycle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Instrument of Data Collection</head><p>The following instrument was used in collecting the data of the research:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1. Interview</formula><p>The kind of interview in this research was structured interview or guide interview. The guide of interview was asked the English teacher and some students of MA Tahfzhil Quran Islamic Centre. In interviewing the researcher recorded or wrote in a note based on the questions that had prepared before by the researcher. So as an instrument to collect the data from the interview we have to prepare a paper of questions, a pen, or a tape record.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observation sheet</head><p>There are two kinds of observation sheet used during observation. They are the observation sheet of the students' activities during the learning in the classroom and the observation sheet of the teachers' activities during the learning in the classroom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Diary note</head><p>Diary notes are the records of the events during the research is conducted.</p><p>These note tell about the activities which are done from the first until the lass meeting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Test</head><p>Test wasconducted to know the students ability in reading comprehension. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Technique of Data Collection</head><p>There are two types for collecting data, they are qualitative data and quantitative data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F.1 Qualitative data</head><p>The qualitative data describes the condition, situation, and response of the students during teaching learning process. The qualitative data of this research is collected by using interview, observation, and diary note, the explanation as follow:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Interview</head><p>Interview is a technique to collect the data directly between the researcher and the participants, in interview the researcher and the participant are face to face. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> .</p><p>In this case, the researcher interviewed the teacher and some students about learning and teaching English. The first step the researcher was made an appointment with the English teacher and students,it would be done in the school area and asked them about the things that connected with this research. The interview was wrote down in a note.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observation sheet 25</head><p>SuryanidanHendrayadi,(2015) metoderisetkuantitatif, Jakarta: prenadamediagrup, p.183.</p><p>Observation is a technique to collect the data by observing the activities that happen. And make a note by using check list, anecdotal record, and rating scale. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> In this step, the observer took a note for every event that occurred in the classroom in order to got accurate data to repair next cycle. It held when the classroom action research was in progress. And in this step the English teacher as the observer. The indicators in the observation sheet were: the technique of conducting the strategy of CORI, the teachers' way in teaching process, and the students participate in learning process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Diary notes</head><p>Diary note is done to write and to report the moments of events and daily activity that happen in the class. The diary note is using to know the progress of the students in learning process. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> A diary notes can also contain data collected by other research methods. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> In this case the researcher took a note to write and to report the moments of events and daily activity in learning process, the researcher seen the progress of the students in learning process. These useful of this data were to see the condition of the class, the daily activity of the students and the progress of the students result in learning process. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F.2. Quantitative Data</head><p>The researcher gave tests of reading comprehension they werepre-test and post-test which were used to collect the data of the improvement. On the pre test the students were instructed to read a text and answer 10 multiple choice questions which related to the texts and pre test was given before doing treatment. While in post test the researcher was instructed the students to read a text and answer 10 multiple choices questions which related to text after doing treatment in the first cycle.</p><p>The questions in the pre test and post test1 were same. While the questions in the post 2 were different, the researcher gavepost test 2 if the researcher got fail in the first cycle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Technique of Analyzing the Data</head><p>The classroom action research in this study was successful if there is an improvement of students' reading comprehension. This could see when the students could do the test and got the standard value, the students feel it easy and enjoy learning reading in the classroom. In this research the researcher was analyzed the data by using quantitative and qualitative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G.1 Quantitative Data</head><p>The quantitative data was used to analyze data from the result of teaching learning process. In analyzing quantitative data, the researcher used descriptive statistic. The quantitative data were analyzed by comparing the mean scores of the pre-test and the post-test to know the difference before and after the cycle. Then, the researcher compared those scores. The improvement could see from the scores of post-test which was higher than the score in the pre-test. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G.2 Qualitative Data</head><p>The qualitative data was used to analyzed the data that were taken during the teaching learning process. The writer used the indicators that show the improvement of the students' reading comprehension. In analyzing the qualitative data, the researcher was analyzed the data from the result of observation, interview, diary note to describe how the process of teaching reading by using</p><p>Concept Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) runs in the classroom.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr">McKernan (1996)</ref> in <ref type="bibr">Burns (1999: 156-160</ref>) there are five steps in analyzing the data. They are:</p><p>a. Assembling the data assemble the data that the researcher has collected over the period of the research: field notes, interview, and so on. At this step, broad patterns should begin to show up which can be compared and contrasted to see what fits together.</p><p>In this step the researcher was analyzed the data to assemble and to select the data which had collected by interview, observation, and diary note. So the data could compare and contrast.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b. Coding the data</head><p>Coding is a process of attempting to reduce the large amount of data that may be collected to more manageable categories of concepts, themes, or types. In this step the researcher was reduced the data which had selected in the first step, so, data will more manageable categories of concepts, themes, or types, data which has analyzed become more clear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>c. Comparing the data</head><p>Comparison is made to see whether themes or patterns are repeated or developed across different data gathering techniques. At this step, the researcher is able to map frequencies of occurrences, behaviors or responses. The main aim at this step is to describe and display the data rather than to interpret or explain them.</p><p>In this step the researcher described and displayed the data which had reduced at the second step, the aim of this step is described and displayed the data rather than to interpret or explain them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>d. Building interpretations</head><p>This is the point where the researcher moves beyond describing, categorizing, coding, and comparing to make some sense of the meaning of the data.</p><p>In this step the researcher was found out the sense of the meaning from data. In this step the researcher was tried to make a conclusion or interpretation from the data which has got from the interview, observation, and diary note.</p><p>e. Reporting the outcomes This step involves presenting an account of the research for others. 30 This is the last and the important one in analyzing the qualitative data, because in this step the researcher will present and report an account of the research for other.</p><p>Finally, by analyzing the data from qualitative and quantitative data, the researcher was able to draw a conclusion whether or not Concept Oriented</p><p>Reading Instruction (CORI) could improve students' reading comprehension. If almost the students gave positive response to the teaching learning activities and their post-test score was higher than pre-test score, Concept Oriented Reading Instruction strategy (CORI) was successful in improving the students' reading 30 E. Milaningrum, (2011), Thesis "Improving The students ability in reading comprehension by using buzz group technique" Surakarta: p. 40, <ref type="bibr">41,42.</ref> comprehension, but if the students gave negative response during the lesson and their post-test is lower than pre-test, Concept Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) was not successful in improving the students' reading comprehension.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DATA ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH FINDING</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Data Description</head><p>The data was analyzed by quantitative and qualitative data.</p><p>Thequantitative data were taken from the mean of the students' score. The qualitative data were taken from observation sheet, interview, and diary note. This research was conducted in one class with 26students. This research was accomplished in two cycles. Each cycle consisted offour steps of action research (planning, acting, observing, and reflecting). Thefirst cycle including pre-test conducted in two meetings. The second cycle wasconducted in two meetings. In the last meeting of each cycle, the students weretaken the test as the post test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1 The Qualitative Data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a. Interview</head><p>The interview was done before conducting the first cycle. The researcherinterviewed the teacher and the students. This interview was also done after implementing the technique. From the students and teacher's answer in interview showed that there were differentfeeling before and after implementing the strategy.</p><p>The teacher felt the learning process was more active and students'reading comprehension was improved after the technique implemented. The students also showedthat they felt pleasure and enjoyed learning the reading comprehension by usingConcept Oriented Reading Instruction.(See the Appendix X and XI).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b. Observation</head><p>The observation was conducted to observe the activity of teacher and students during the learning process, included the students' behavior, attitude, attention, and all activities during the learning process. Thus the result of observation was collected as the data, and the data used as basic reflection. In this research, the researcher acted as a teacher in the class, and the observer was the English teacher who observed the activity during the learning process. We worked together to solve the students' problem in learning.</p><p>The observation sheet was prepared for the teacher and students. From the observation, the researcher notedthat the teacher has done all the activities in learning process, and the students were so excited, active, and enthusiastic in learning readingby using Concept Oriented Reading Instruction strategy.(See the Appendix XII and XIII).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>c. Diary note</head><p>Diary note was done in the first meeting and second meeting.The researcher wrote the moments of events and daily activities in the class. It was taken when the students did the reading test, and during theteaching-learning process in the classroom. From the diary note will be found that thestudents result in learning process was progress. (See appendix XIV).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2. The Quantitative Data</head><p>The quantitative data were taken from the result of the test given to the students. The test that given still relevant to the topic taught and discussed in the classroom in every cycle. There were two cycles consisted of four meeting in this research and the test was given in the last of each cycles. The results of the test score of students were shown in the table.  From the data above the researcher found there is the improving of thestudents' reading comprehension. It could be seen from the mean of the value from pre-test, posttestof cycle I and post-test of cycle II that increase. It also could be seen from thetable below that showed the students value failed or passed.</p><p>From the table above the writer found the students' achievement are:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-Test</head><p>In the Pre-test the students score include to the low result, because in Pre testthe students did not understand yet about the material and still shy to ask theteacher. It gave influence in students' reading comprehension. From the table it showed inthe pre-test there were five students who able to pass the passing grade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-Test I</head><p>In the Post-Test I the students score got improving. In the post-test</p><p>Istudents had given the reaction to pay more attention to the teacher and asked thematerial that they did not know. And the reaction of the students gave influence instudents' achievement to improve. From the table it showed in the post-test I there are sixteen persons who able to pass the passing grade 75.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-Test II</head><p>In the post-test II the students score got increasing. In the post-test II studentsgave the positive reaction and more motivated in doing the test, the students alsoby Concept Oriented Reading Instruction created the supportive condition in got the high score. Thestudents' reaction and motivation increased the students' achievement. From thetable it showed in the post test II there were twenty people who pass the passing grade 75. It means more than 50 % students could improved their reading comprehension by using Concept Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Data Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.1. The Qualitative Data</head><p>The qualitative data was analyzed from observation sheet and interview sheet. The research was done in two cycles, and each cycle consists of two meetingsand one test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a. The First Cycle</head><p>The first cycle was done in two meetings, the detail was below:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Planning</head><p>The plan was arranged before researcher conducting the research. All the materials above used by researcher to teach the students in theclassroom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Action</head><p>In this classroom action research, the researcher had done some cases in the action step. The researcher implemented Concept Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) strategy in teaching learning process and the researcher had done all of procedures that mentioned in planning step. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The teacher used Concept Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI)</head><p>strategy in teaching reading comprehension based on the text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">The students asked about rule of Concept Oriented Reading Instruction</head><p>(CORI) strategy.</p><p>6. The teacher and the students discussed about the text.</p><p>c. Closing</p><p>1. The teacher and students concluded the text together to know howfar the students understand about the text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Observation</head><p>The observation was done to observe how the students' behavior and what the students' problems during the teaching-learning process. Most of the students had participated effectively during teaching and learning process and also whenthey did Concept Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) strategy in the class although some of them still lack ofunderstanding about the text. They were enthusiastic and enjoyable about thetopic which discussed by teacher in classroom. They also seriously to answer theexercise.</p><p>To know further about the students' activity could be seen in diary note which wrote by researcher during the teaching-learning process inclassroom. We could see the students enjoyable, happy and enthusiastic thanbefore. (See Appendix XII)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Reflection</head><p>Based on the result of the score of the test in cycle I and also observation,action of increasing was needed. Actually, the students' score in the first cycle had improved than the score of pre-test. But, it was needed more increasing in their reading comprehension because some of them still confused and difficult to understand the text.In the second cycle, researcher as teacher improved the students' reading comprehension by giving more explanation about the text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b. The Second Cycle</head><p>After doing the first cycle, the students' problems were found and itgave information about the students' reading comprehension. Therefore, researcher had a good motivation to conduct the second cycleof action research which was carried out in two meetings. It was expected that thesecond cycle of action research got better than the first cycle. In this cycle,researcher gave the motivation and also more explanation about the material. Thesecond cycle of action research as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Planning II</head><p>In this phase, the researcher prepared lesson plan and emphasized theteaching-learning process in teaching reading comprehension. In this cycle, the researcherexplained more deeply about the material in supposed the students could improveand comprehending the text. Besides that, the researcher as theteacher used some pictures as media to make the students more interest and developed theircreativity and also more focus in the material. The researcher also created thesupportive and active situation in the class during teaching-learning process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Action II</head><p>In this phase, the teacher supported the students by giving motivation tomake them felt spirit and always struggle to did the lesson and what they werefacing. In this phase, the lesson plan that had been arranged was implemented well in the classroom. In this steps, there were some activities done by the researcher as follow:</p><p>a. Procedure 2. The teacher gave some clues to students, to make the students easily in comprehending the text.</p><p>3. The teacher asked the difficult to the students during teaching learning process.</p><p>4. The teacher and the students discussed about the text.</p><p>c. Closing</p><p>1. The teacher and students concluded the text together to know howfar the students understand about the text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Observation II</head><p>The observation was still done for the last time. The activity of studentswas observed and it showed that most of the students did not have problems anymore about the text. They liked to learn about reading byusing Concept Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) strategy which given by the teacher. They were active during teaching learning process and more enthusiastic than before. The observation also could be taken from interviewed in each meeting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Reflection II</head><p>Having checked the students' reading comprehension by giving test to them,it was found that the students' score showed the increasing. Based on theobservation and the result of their test, the researcher concluded that the studentscould improve their reading comprehension by using Concept Oriented</p><p>Reading Instruction (CORI) strategy. Thestudents' score in the second cycle had improved than in the first cycle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.2. The Quantitative Data</head><p>The data was taken from test that gave to the students in the last of eachcycle. Based on the result of every meeting and the tests in every cycle whichhave been conducted, it was found that the students score kept improve since thefirst until the last meeting. It can be seen from the students' score increased fromthe pre-test, post-test in cycle I until the post-test in cycle II. The students' scorein post-test of cycle I was higher than the pre-test, and the post-test of cycle II washigher than the post-test of cycle I. So the mean of the students was: x = 50.5</p><p>From the analysis above knew that students' reading comprehending werevery low. The mean of the students was 50.5and the student categories still inpoor level. And the number of the students who were competent in vocabulary inwas calculated by applying the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P = x 100%</formula><p>Where: P = The percentage of those who got the points up 75 R = The number of students who get the points up to 75 T = The total number of the students P1 = x 100% = 19.2% From the percentage above known that the students who competent inreading comprehension were very low. From the table of post-test of cycle I, the total score of the students was1890 and the number of the students completed took the test from pre-test, From the analysis, knew that the student's reading comprehension gotimproving. The mean of the students was70.3and include fair level. And thenumber of the students who were competent in reading comprehension test was calculated byapplying the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P2= x 100% = 100%</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">P = x 100%</formula><p>Where: P = The percentage of those who got the points up 75 R = The number of students who get the points up to 75 T = The total number of the students P1 = x 100% = 61.5% From the analysis, knew that the student's reading comprehension gotimproving. The mean of the students was 70.1. From the score who got &lt;75</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P2= x 100% = 100%</formula><p>were16or it was61.5% and 10 students got the score under&gt;75 or it was38.5%. It could be concluded that the student's reading comprehension in gothigher in post- test in cycle I than pre-test. But, the student's achievement in thepost-test of cycle I was categorized unsuccessful. Because the percentage of thestudents who pass the passing grade only61.5%, the researcher wanted thepercentage of students who pass the passing grade was 75 %. Therefore the nextaction continued on the cycle II.   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="26">100%</head><p>From the percentage, the student's reading comprehension was classified on goodlevel when doing the action research on cycle II.The student's score showed the improving which could be determined thatthey showed the progress little by little. They got the increasing score in eachcycle. The mean of the students' score in the post-test of cycle II was highest,soit could be said that the students' reading comprehension by using Concept Oriented</p><p>Reading Instruction (CORI) strategy improved from 50.5 to 80.1.</p><p>The number of the students who werecompetent in reading comprehension was calculated by applying the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P = x 100%</formula><p>Where: P = The percentage of those who got the points up 75 R = The number of students who get the points up to 75 T = The total number of the students</p><p>The percentage of the increasing of students' vocabulary mastery could be seen as follows:</p><p>a. The percentage of competent students in the pre-test was:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P1 = x 100% = 19.3%</formula><p>b. The percentage of the competent students in the post-test I was:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P1 = x 100% = 61.5%</formula><p>c. The percentage of the competent students in the post-test II was: From the table above, the result showed the improving of the students'scores from the pre-test to the post-test of cycle I, post-test of cycle I to post-testcycle II. In the first test (pre-test) the students who got the score 75 were 5 students of 26 students (19.3% ). In the second test (post-test cycle I) the studentswho got the score 75 were 16students of 26 students (61.5%). In the third test(post-test cycle II) the students who got the score 75 were 22 students of 40students (80.7%). The improving of the pre-test to the post-test of cycle I was about42.3% and the improving of post-test of cycle I to the post-test of cycle II wasabout 19.2%.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P1 = x 100% = 80.7%</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Research Finding</head><p>The result indicated that there was an improving on the students' reading comprehension by using Concept Oriented Reading Instruction strategy. The mean of the first cycle was 70.1, it was good enough. The mean of second cycle was 80.1, it indicated that the scores and the mean in second cycle were better than the first cycle. The percentage of students who got point &gt; 75 also grew up.</p><p>In the pre-test, the students who got point &gt; 75 up were 5 students (19.3 %). In the post-test of cycle I students who got point 75 up were 16 students (61.5%). It means that there was an improving about 61.5 %. The post-test of cycle II, students who got point 75 to up there were 21 students (80.7%) and the improving was about 19.2%. For the total improving of the students' score from pre-test to post-test of cycle II was 80.7 %. In other words, the students' reading comprehension improved and became well in the first meeting to the next meeting.</p><p>The researcher also analyzed qualitative data to support the researchfinding beside the quantitative data. The qualitative data were organized from the, observation sheet and interview. All of these data indicated that thestudents given their attitude and responses during teaching-learning process.Observation sheet for the students, it could be concluded that the students wereactive during the teaching-learning process, although at the first meeting theywere not interest and confused about the meaning of the text and some of themwere shy and afraid of asking what they did not know. There were some studentsfound chatting and made some noisy. But the next meeting was better than theprevious meeting because they were less of mistakes. From interview, it wasfound that the student felt interesting in learning reading comprehension from day by day.</p><p>From Diary note it was found that student were active and enthusiastic infollowing teaching-learning process. In this basedon the result of thequantitative and qualitative data, it could be concluded that Concept Oriented Reading Instruction could improve students' reading comprehension especially at Ten</p><p>Grade MA Tahfizhil Quran Islamic Centre.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Discussion</head><p>This research was conducted to find out the improving of the students' reading comprehension by using Concept Oriented Reading Instruction. Concept</p><p>Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) strategy was one of strategy that could be used by the teacher in teaching English to improve the students' reading comprehension.</p><p>Based on the result of the research in quantitative data by using Concept</p><p>Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) could help the students in improving the students' reading comprehension in the first meeting to the next meeting.</p><p>And based on the qualitative data, it showed the increasing of teacher'sand students' activity during teaching-learning process. The data could be seen from observation sheet, interview sheet and diary note that indicated the students were active and paid attention the subject that the teacher taught.</p><p>So, it could be concluded that the students' reading comprehension got improved after being taught using Concept Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) strategy , the researcher found it enough to stop the research in cycle II because the result has met success indicator of the research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R : Ok good morning Sir?</head><p>T : yes, good morning too. T : CORI, I think it can applied to teach reading comprehension. It effectively applied, because students are given some picture before they read the reading text. So firstly they can imagine what stories about, after they know what story about they can comprehend the text easily.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R : do you think CORI can improve your students' reading comprehension?</head><p>T : yes I think CORI can improve the students' reading comprehension and make the students more active and enthusiastic.</p></div>

The implementation of scoring by analyzing rubric assessment for reading narrative text. Based on the curriculum assessment reveals that reading comprehension is approximately 40 percent of grade level material. The standardized test score indicates a general need in reading comprehension, the measured beginning level of performance provides a frame of benchmark for an annual goal to improve reading comprehension to 70 percent and 80 percent. 29 So, to categorize the percentage of the studentswho were competent in reading comprehension.The following formula was applied: 29 Edward Burns, (2006), Writing and Implementing Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), New York: Charles C Thomas Publisher, p.90 P = x 100% Where: P = The percentage of those who got the points up 75 R = The number of students who get the points up to 75 T = The total number of the students Then, to see the different of the test successful test after using the Concept Oriented Reading Instruction strategy.

Once upon a time, in Dumai, there was a Kingdom named Seri Bunga Tanjung. 

The leader of the kingdom was Queen Cik Sima. She had seven beautiful 

daughters. The most beautiful one was the youngest daughter. 

One day, the seven princesses took bath in Sarang Umai pool, making joke 

and remaining in the water for long time. While doing so, they were noticed by 

some guys. Those were Prince Empang and his guardsmen who were passing by 

the pool. They peeped at the seven princesses through shady bushes nearby the 

pool. The prince was amazed of seeing those beautiful ladies, but his eyes could 

not stop watching the most beautiful, Princess Mayang Sari. (Beautiful lady in 

Umai pool in Umai...ya..in Umai) mumbled Prince Empang Kuala. Seemingly, 

the prince felt in love with Mayang Mengurai. He set his heart upon marrying her.
